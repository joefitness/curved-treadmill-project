This is an example blog post to show how the preview works. Only this first paragraph will appear on the main blog listing page, giving readers a quick overview of what the post is about.

## Second Section

When you click "Read more," you'll see the full post including this section and everything below it.

### Code Examples

You can include code blocks:

```javascript
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Lists

Unordered lists work great:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

And numbered lists too:

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

### Quotes

> This is a blockquote. It's great for highlighting important information or quotes from other sources.

### Images

You can also include images (just add them to your repository):

```markdown
![Alt text](path/to/image.jpg)
```

## Conclusion

That's all for this example post. The markdown-to-HTML conversion handles all standard markdown syntax, making it easy to write rich, formatted content.
