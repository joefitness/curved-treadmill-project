Welcome to my blog! This is the first post to demonstrate how the blog system works. The front matter at the top of this markdown file contains metadata like the title, dates, and tags.

## How It Works

This blog system loads markdown files and parses the front matter to extract metadata. The main page shows just the first paragraph of each post, and you can click through to read the full content.

## Features

- Clean, mobile-first design
- Custom front matter parsing (no dependencies needed)
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Simple black and white color scheme for easy reading
- Automatic sorting by publish date

## Writing Posts

To create a new post, simply create a `.md` file in the `posts` directory with front matter at the top. Here's what the front matter should look like:

```
---
title: Your Post Title
date: 2024-01-15
updated: 2024-01-20
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---
```

After the front matter (after the second `---`), write your content in standard markdown format.

## Next Steps

Try creating your own posts and customizing the design to match your style. Happy blogging!
