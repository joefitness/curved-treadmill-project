    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies on rest durations during high-intensity interval training (HIIT) often compare fixed and self-selected (SS) rest allocation approaches.  Frequently, the rest duration under SS conditions is unlimited, leading to  inconsistent total rest durations compared to fixed rest conditions. To address  this limitation, we recently compared fixed and SS rest conditions during cycling  HIIT sessions, while keeping the total rest duration equivalent. However, our  protocol required athletes to divide a long total rest duration (720s) across  nine intervals, which may have been overly cognitively demanding. The current  study aimed to explore the effects of the SS approach with a simplified rest  allocation task on performance, physiological, and psychological outcomes.  METHODS: Following a familiarization session, 24 professional female soccer  players completed two running HIIT sessions on a non-motorized treadmill. Each  session consisted of twelve 15s intervals, divided into three blocks, with the  goal of maximizing the distance covered. In both conditions, the between-interval  rest duration per block amounted to 270s. In the fixed condition, the rest was  uniformly allocated to 90s between each interval, whereas in the SS condition,  the athletes chose how to allocate the entirety of the 270s of rest. We compared  the following outcomes: distance, heart rate, perception of fatigue, effort,  autonomy, enjoyment, boredom, and athletes' preferences. Outcomes were compared  using aggregated measures via paired univariate tests, and across the intervals  via mixed-effects models. RESULTS: We observed comparable results in most  outcomes with the exception of higher autonomy (1-15 points) in the SS condition  (mean difference=2.1, 95%CI (0.9, 3.3) points) and a negligibly higher heart  rate in the SS condition when comparing the observations across intervals  (estimate=2.5, 95%CI (0.9, 4.2) beats X min(-1)). Additionally, participants  chose to rest for longer durations as the block progressed. Finally, the majority  of participants (65%) favored the SS condition. CONCLUSION: This study further  solidifies that SS and fixed approaches with matched total rest durations result  in similar performance, physiological, and psychological responses. This effect  persists even when the total rest duration required to be allocated is relatively  short. Therefore, coaches and trainees can choose either approach based on their  preferences and training goals.",

    "abstract": "Background: The influence of load carriage in operational police officers is not well understood despite a relatively high injury rate. Assessing load related changes in head and torso coordination may provide valuable insight into plausible injury mechanisms. Research question: Do typical police tactical vest loads alter head and torso coordination during running?  Methods: Thirty-eight UK police officers ran at a self-selected pace (>2 ms 1) on a non-motorised treadmill in four vest load conditions (unloaded, and low, high and evenly distributed loads). Peak head and torso tilt, and peak vest displacement were compared between all four conditions. Timings between vest and torso change of direction were compared between the three loaded conditions. The coupling angle between the head and torso calculated using modified vector coding were compared between unloaded and each loaded conditions using Statistical Parametric Mapping. Results: No significant differences were found between conditions for peak head or torso tilt alone (p > 0.05). Loading equipment low on the vest led to significantly greater mediolateral vest displacements (38 mm) away from the torso than a high (34 mm) or evenly distributed (30 mm) conditions. The vest was found to change direction vertically before the torso in the anterior-posterior direction, and then influence torso motion. The loaded conditions changed the head-torso coupling from in-phase (with head-dominancy) to anti-phase (with torso dominancy) between 55% and 77% stance. Anti-phase with a relatively stationary head and the torso rotating forward likely places a greater concentric demand on the posterior neck muscles relative to unloaded running. Significance: Current tactical vest designs allow significant extra displacement of load away from the body during running, altering coordination at the head and torso. N = 38 (24 males (M); age (years) M 44 \u00b1 7, F 40 \u00b1 9)",

Thirty-eight athletes aged 17 to 25 years old participated in the study, including 18 with a history of concussion. The dual-task paradigm required walking continuously at a predetermined self-paced target speed of 6.5 km/h while executing a complex switch task. Athletes completed two conditions, each on separate days: (1) dual task alone and (2) dual task following 20 min of running on a non-motorized treadmill. The statistical analyses revealed a significant reduction in gait speed exclusively for athletes with a history of concussion and only following the post-exercise condition (p = 0.008). These findings suggest that although asymptomatic concussed athletes maintain a cognitive performance comparable to non-concussed athletes, this appears to be achieved at the expense of gait speed. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating gait assessments and post-exercise exertion into concussion evaluation protocols in both research and clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a commonly used clinical and research test to assess aerobic capacity. However, in many settings, the 30-m corridor required to conduct the test may not be available. Evaluation of the use of a non-motorized treadmill as an alternative method has not been well studied. PURPOSE: This study compared the distances walked during the traditional (TRAD) 6MWT on a flat indoor surface to a non-motorized treadmill (NMT) to validate the use of the NMT as an alternative testing method. METHODS: A total of 55 healthy adults (28 females) completed the TRAD 6MWT and NMT 6MWT during the same testing session (randomized order). The levels of agreement between the two methods were quantified using Lin's concordance correlation coefficients. Additionally, a multiple linear regression was developed to predict TRAD 6MWT distance with covariates age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) from NMT distance walked. RESULTS: The average TRAD distance walked was 630 m and the average NMT distance walked was 607 m. The mean difference of 23 m between the two methods was nonsignificant. There was good agreement between methods (rc = 0.84) showing no differences. A multiple linear regression was developed and revealed that NMT distance significantly predicted TRAD distance when controlling for age, sex, height, and weight (Standardized Beta = 0.791, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The use of the NMT for 6MWT was deemed a valid and feasible replacement for the TRAD 6MWT based on the results of this study. N=55 \u00b1 15 (28 Females).

    "abstract": "Walking is a common and preferred form of exercise. Although there are current recommendations for walking volume (e.g., steps per day), recent research has begun to distinguish volume from intensity (e.g., \u201cbrisk\u201d walking) as an important dimension of exercise. Increasing intensity may confer health advantages beyond volume measures because it shifts cardiovascular performance to more vigorous training zones. Reinforcement-based approaches have been valuable in increasing volume measures of exercise, and the present study sought to develop a corresponding reinforcement approach to training walking intensity. For this study, we used a continuous reinforcement paradigm where music played only while walking met specified criteria; otherwise, music playback stopped. As a result, music was synchronized with walking performance. Seventeen participants walked on a nonmotorized treadmill at a self-selected pace. Across the session, different conditions arranged for music to play independent of walking speed or contingent on speed increases or decreases. An extinction component assessed performance when music was withdrawn completely. Walking speed was selectively increased and decreased by adjusting the contingencies that were arranged for music, and variability in speed increased during extinction, with both findings indicating that music was a reinforcer. Heart rate was also increased to moderate-vigorous intensities during reinforcement. The findings provide a compelling case that walking intensity can be modified by music reinforcement. We suggest that synchronous schedules may be an important foundation for future exercise technologies that are based on reinforcement. N=17 Women (mean age = 22)",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if curved non-motorized treadmills can reproduce overground running better than motorized treadmills by analysing the differences in joint kinematics (hip, knee, and ankle) using SPM. Nineteen recreational runners completed three randomized running tests on these surfaces. Kinematic data from the hip, knee, and ankle joints were collected. Two-tailed SPM t-tests were performed to analyse time-continuous gait cycles in three anatomical planes of each joint. Higher within-subject variability was observed in the frontal and transverse planes during curved non-motorized treadmill running. SPM analysis showed more significant differences (p < 0.05) between curved nonmotorized treadmill and overground than between motorized treadmill and overground, mainly in knee (from 12% to 30% and 93% to 99% of the gait cycle) and ankle (from 19% to 23% of the gait cycle) in the sagittal plane. Therefore, running on curved non-motorized treadmills is more biomechanically different compared to overground than motorized treadmills, and might not be the best strategy to replicate overground running in terms of joint kinematics during highly controlled research studies. However, they could be an interesting tool in rehabilitation or training environments since the changes observed in joint kinematics were likely not functionally relevant.

These differences between the running surfaces may affect impact accelerations during prolonged running. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of the type of running surface (motorised treadmill (MT), curved non-motorised treadmill (cNMT), and overground (OVG)) and prolonged running in impact accelerations, spatiotemporal parameters and perceptual variables. In the current study, twenty-one recreational runners completed three randomised crossover prolonged running test on these surfaces consisting of a 30-minute run at 80% of the individual maximal aerobic speed. A two-way repeated-measure analysis of variance, with the level of significance set at p < 0.05, showed a reduction in impact accelerations, such as tibia peak acceleration, when running on cNMT vs MT (p = 0.001, ES = 4.2) or OVG (p = 0.004, ES = 2.9). Running on cNMT produced an increase in stride frequency (p = 0.023, ES = 0.9) and higher rating of perceived effort (p < 0.001, ES = 8.9) and heart rate (p = 0.001, ES = 2.9) compared to OVG, with no differences between treadmills. These findings suggest that impact accelerations, spatiotemporal parameters, rating of perceived exertion and heart rate are different between the surfaces analysed, what should be taken into consideration when running on these surfaces.

    "abstract": "Soccer is a fast-growing area of research, demonstrated by a 10-fold increase in the number of PubMed articles derived from the search term 'soccer' between 2001 and 2021. The scope of contemporary soccer-related articles ranges from match-play observations to laboratory evaluations of performance. The activity profile of soccer match-play is variable and techniques to collect data within matches are limited. Soccer-specific simulations have been developed to simulate the evolving demands of match-play. The evolutionary designs of novel simulations provide a reproducible exercise stimulus for varying researcher and practitioner objectives. The applied researcher can utilise simulations to investigate the efficacy of nutritional interventions and environmental stress on performance, while assessing the physiological and biomechanical responses to representations of match-play. Practitioners can adopt simulations for rehabilitation to progressively facilitate return-to-play processes, while implementing extra top-up conditioning sessions for unused and partial-match players. However, there are complexities involved with the selection of varying simulations which are dependent on the research question or practical application. There also remains a paucity of published information to support researchers and practitioners in selecting from differing simulation models. To assist with researcher and practitioner interpretations, we present a commentary of the current simulations to inform decision-making processes for research and training purposes and enhance the application of future research. An objective scoring system was adopted for rating the research and practical applications of each simulation design. Overall scores of 22, 16 and 18 out of 36 were revealed for free-running (n = 7), non-motorised- (n = 4) and motorised-treadmill-based simulations (n = 4), respectively.",

    "abstract": "Background: People with femoroacetabular with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) often report pain during sports involving repeated sprinting. It remains unclear how sports participation influences running biomechanics in individuals with FAIS.  Hypothesis: Changes in running biomechanics and/or isometric hip strength after repeated sprint exercise would be greatest in individuals with FAIS compared with asymptomatic individuals with (CAM) and without cam morphology (Control).  Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.  Level of Evidence: Level 3.  Methods: Three-dimensional hip biomechanics during maximal running (10 m) and hip strength were measured in 49 recreationally active individuals (FAIS = 15; CAM = 16; Control = 18) before and after repeated sprint exercise performed on a nonmotorized treadmill (8-16 x 30 m). Effects of group and time were assessed for biomechanics and strength variables with repeated-measures analyses of variance. Relationships between hip pain (Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score) and changes in hip moments and strength after repeated sprint exercise were determined using Spearman's correlation coefficients (ρ).  Results: Running speed, hip flexion angles, hip flexion and extension moments, and hip strength in all muscle groups were significantly reduced from pre to post. No significant between-group differences were observed before or after repeated sprint exercise. No significant relationships (ρ = 0.04-0.30) were observed between hip pain and changes in hip moments or strength in the FAIS group.  Conclusion: Changes in running biomechanics and strength after repeated sprint exercise did not differ between participants with FAIS and asymptomatic participants with and without cam morphology. Self-reported pain did not appear to influence biomechanics during running or strength after repeated sprint exercise in participants with FAIS.  Clinical Relevance: A short bout of repeated sprinting may not elicit changes in running biomechanics in FAIS beyond what occurs in those without symptoms. Longer duration activities or activities requiring greater hip flexion angles may better provoke pathology-related changes in running biomechanics in people with FAIS.",

This study aimed to assess IMU measurement accuracy during high-speed running and maximal effort sprinting on a curved non-motorized treadmill using discrete (Bland-Altman analysis) and continuous (root mean square error [RMSE], normalised RMSE, Pearson correlation, and statistical parametric mapping analysis [SPM]) metrics. The hip, knee, and ankle flexions and the pelvic orientation (tilt, obliquity, and rotation) were captured concurrently from both IMU and optical motion capture systems, as 20 participants ran steadily at 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% of their maximal effort sprinting speed (5.36 ± 0.55, 6.02 ± 0.60, 6.66 ± 0.71, and 7.09 ± 0.73 m/s, respectively). Bland-Altman analysis indicated a systematic bias within ±1◦ for the peak pelvic tilt, rotation, and lower-limb kinematics and -3.3◦ to -4.1◦ for the pelvic obliquity. The SPM analysis demonstrated a good agreement in the hip and knee flexion angles for most phases of the stride cycle, albeit with significant differences noted around the ipsilateral toe-off. The RMSE ranged from 4.3◦ (pelvic obliquity at 70% speed) to 7.8◦ (hip flexion at 100% speed). Correlation coefficients ranged from 0.44 (pelvic tilt at 90%) to 0.99 (hip and knee flexions at all speeds). Running speed minimally but significantly affected the RMSE for the hip and ankle flexions. The present IMU system is effective for measuring lower-limb kinematics during sprinting, but the pelvic orientation estimation was less accurate. N=20 (14 males, 6 females; age: 26.8 ± 5.5 years)",

Twenty-six recreationally active men (n 5 12) and women (n 5 14) between the ages of 18 and 35 years old (21.5 6 2.4 years) completed the 30nmt at 9:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 7:00 PM in a randomized order over a 24-hour period. Resting heart rate and temperature assessments were taken at each visit. A dietary recall and the MorningnessEveningness Questionnaire were used to assess kilocalories (kcals) and chronotype, respectively. Two-way (time x sex) repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted to determine differences in peak/mean power, peak/mean velocity, distance, resting heart rate, temperature, and kcals at each time point. Paired sample t tests were used to assess peak and nadir of each performance variable. A significance level was set at p , 0.05. There was a significant main effect for temperature (p , 0.001), resting heart rate (p 5 0.007), and pre-exercise caloric intake (p 5 0.021) throughout the day. No significant main effects for time were found for peak power (p 5 0.766), mean power (p 5 0.094), peak velocity (p 5 0.497), mean velocity (p 5 0.193), or distance (p 5 0.262).

    "abstract": "An increase in the popularity of running can be seen over the last decades, with a large number of injuries on it. Most of the running injuries are related to impact accelerations and are due to overuse. In order to reduce the risk of injury or to improve performance and health new treadmill designs have been created, as it can be the curved non-motorized treadmill. The aim of this study was to analyse impact accelerations, spatio-temporal parameters and perceptual differences while running on curved non-motorized treadmill (cNMT) compared to motorized treadmill (MT) at different speeds. Therefore, 27 recreational runners completed two tests consisting of 10 min warm-up and three bouts of 8 min running at 2.77 m/s, 3.33 m/s and self-selected speed on cNMT and MT, previously randomised. Although the surface did not influence spatio-temporal parameters, a reduction in impact accelerations, head acceleration rate (mean effect size [ES] = 0.86), tibia peak (mean ES = 0.45) and tibia magnitude (mean ES = 0.55), was observed while running on cNMT in comparison with running on MT. Moreover, higher heart rate (HR) (mean ES = 0.51) and rating of perceived effort (RPE) (mean ES = 0.34) were found while running on cNMT. These findings demonstrated that higher intensity training and lower impact accelerations are experimented on cNMT, what can be used by trainers and athletes while planning training sessions.

Design: Observational with repeated-measures.  Methods: Recreational athletes (n=18 (9 females), age=26.2±6.2 years) performed 12 maximal 30metre sprints on a non-motorised treadmill. Three-dimensional kinematics and ground reaction forces  were subsequently recorded during a 10-metre maximal overground sprint before and immediately after  the repeated running protocol, from which we calculated work done by sagittal plane hip, knee, and  ankle moments. Relative work (J/kg) was reported as a percentage of positive and negative work done  by the sum of joint moments.  Results: Following the repeated running protocol, maximal sprint speed decreased by 19% and was  accompanied by reductions in total positive (-1.47 J/kg) and negative (-0.92 J/kg) work, in addition to  work done by hip (-0.43 to -0.82 J/kg) and knee (-0.28 J/kg) moments during swing. Compared to before  the repeated running protocol, less relative work was done by hip extension (-9%) and knee  flexion/extension (-3%) moments during swing. Reductions in work done by hip and knee joint  moments during swing were significantly correlated with reductions in maximum running speed  (r=0.61-0.89, p<0.05).  Conclusions: A sports-specific repeated sprint protocol resulted in reductions in mechanical work done  by sagittal plane hip and knee joint moments during maximal overground sprinting. Interventions  focused on maintaining positive work done by the hip flexors/extensors and negative work done by  knee flexors/extensors during the swing phase of running may help prevent reductions in speed  following repeated sprinting.

The research was carried out in the “Planica Nordic Centre—PNC” in the wind tunnel system, where the AirRunner Assault treadmill, which was equipped with four sensors measuring the vertical and horizontal ground reaction forces, was installed. To obtain biokinetic data, the runners performed the treadmill's run under conditions of airflow directed at each participant's back (backwind speeds +3 m/s and +5 m/s) and the chest (headwind speeds -5 m/s and -7 m/s). The runner's speed was measured via image analysis using a DSLR camera and markers on the belt of the treadmill. Additionally, a high-speed camera synchronised to the force acquisition system was used to analyse the contact phase via comparison of foot placement and time series of the ground reaction forces. The contact phases of the running step were found to be longer than the flight phases, with their duration ranging from 0.15 to 0.20 s and the maximum forces at take-off were found to be greater than when running with the backwind. It should be noted that the application of high-tech devices wind tunnel and treadmill were found to be sufficiently accurate to perform kinetic measurements of running parameters in changing conditions, such as resistance and assistance (facilitating).

This study investigated the effect of discontinuous, running-based RSH, on repeated-sprint treadmill performance in hypoxia in a team sport cohort, prior to international competition. Over a 6-week “in-season” period, 11 elite male players (Malaysia national team) completed eight multi-set RSH sessions on a non-motorized treadmill in a normobaric hypoxic chamber (FiO<sub>2</sub> = 13.8%). Three testing sessions (Sessions 1, 5, and 8), involved three sets of 5 x 8-s sprints, with 52-s recovery between sprints and 4-5 min between sets. Training sessions (Sessions 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7) consisted of four to five sets of 4-5 x 8-s sprints. During testing sessions, maximum sprinting speed was recorded for each sprint with values averaged for each set. For each set, a peak speed and fatigue index were calculated. Data were compared using two-way repeated measures ANOVA (sessions x sets). Average speed per set increased between testing sessions (p = 0.001, η<sup>2</sup>p = 0.49), with higher values in Session 8 (25.1 ± 0.9 km•h<sup>-1</sup>, +4 ± 3%, p = 0.005), but not Session 5 (24.8 ± 1.0 km•h<sup>-1</sup>, +3 ± 3%, p = 0.405), vs. Session 1 (24.2 ± 1.5 km•h<sup>-1</sup>). Peak sprinting speed in each set also increased across testing sessions (p = 0.008, η<sup>2</sup>p = 0.382), with Session 8 (26.5 ± 1.1 km•h<sup>-1</sup>) higher than Session 5 (25.8 ± 1.0 km•h<sup>-1</sup>, +1 ± 4%, p = 0.06) and Session 1 (25.7 ± 1.5 km•h<sup>-1</sup>, +4 ± 4%, p = 0.034).

This study evaluated the effect of virtual reality gait training (VRGT) with non-motorized treadmill on balance and gait ability of elderly individuals who had experienced a fall. Fifty-six elderly individuals living in local communities participated in this study. Subjects who met the selection criteria were randomly divided into a VRGT group (n = 28) and a control group (n = 28). The VRGT group received VRGT with non-motorized treadmill for 50 min a day for 4 weeks and 5 days a week. The control group received non-motorized treadmill gait training without virtual reality for the same amount of time as the VRGT group. Before and after the training, the one-leg-standing test, Berg Balance Scale, Functional Reach test, and Timed Up and Go test were used to assess balance ability, and the gait analyzer system was used to evaluate the improvement in gait spatiotemporal parameters. In the VRGT group, the balance ability variable showed a significant decrease in the one-leg-standing test and a significant improvement in the Timed Up and Go test. With respect to spatiotemporal gait parameters, velocity and step width decreased significantly in the VRGT group (p < 0.05), and stride length and step length were significantly improved in the VRGT group (p < 0.05). VRGT with non-motorized treadmill has been shown to improve balance and gait ability in the elderly.

Fourteen male team-sport athletes performed 2 randomly ordered testing sessions on a nonmotorized treadmill with one session requiring subjects to decelerate (TMd) within 4 seconds before stopping or immediately step to the side of the treadmill belt at the completion of each sprint (TMa). Peak and mean velocities, speed decrement, blood lactate concentrations, and oxygen uptake were monitored during the repeated-sprint running protocols. Countermovement vertical jump (CMJ) performance, perceived muscle soreness, sit-and-reach flexibility, plasma creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and myoglobin (Mb) concentrations were quantified immediately before and after and 45 minutes, 24 and 48 hours after repeated-sprint running protocols. Although muscle damage was indicated by increases in CK, LDH, and Mb (p # 0.05) in both groups, there was no significant effect of condition (TMa vs. TMd) on any of the measured performance or physiological variables (p . 0.05). The present study indicated that the removal of deceleration from repeated-sprint running on a nonmotorized treadmill has no effect on metabolism or performance during or after repeated-sprint running or markers of muscle damage.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate and systematically review the evidence relating to time-of-day based on performance measures in repeated-sprints. The entire content of PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, SPORTDiscus® (via EBSCOhost) and Web of Science was searched. Only experimental research studies conducted in male adult participants aged ≥18yrs, published in English before June 2019 were included. Studies assessing repeatedsprints between a minimum of two time-points during the day (morning versus evening) were deemed eligible. The primary search revealed that a total of 10 out of 112 articles were considered eligible and subsequently included. Seven articles were deemed strong and three moderate quality. Eight studies found repeated-sprint performance across the first, first few, or all sprints, to increase in favor of the evening. The magnitude of difference is dependent on the modality and the exercise protocol used. The non-motorized treadmill established an average 3.5-8.5% difference in distance covered, average and peak velocity, and average power, across all sprints in three studies and in peak power in two studies. In cycling, power output differed across all sprints by 6.0% in one study and 8.0% for the first sprint only in five studies. All four studies measuring power decrement values (i.e. rate of fatigue) established differences up to 4.0% and two out of five studies established total work to be significantly higher by 8.0%. Repeated-sprint performance is affected by time-of-day with greater performance in the late/ early afternoon. The magnitude is dependent on the variable assessed and the mode of exercise. There is a clear demand for more rigorous investigations which control factors that specifically relate to investigations of time-of-day and are specific to the sport of individuals.",

J Strength Cond Res 34(5): 1197-1200, 2020—The current study compared the physiological and perceptual demands of running on a commercially available curved nonmotorized treadmill (cNMT) with different incline grades on a motorized treadmill (MT). Ten male team-sport athletes completed, after a familiarization session, a 6-minute run at a target velocity of 2.78 m·s<sup>-1</sup> on the cNMT (cNMTrun). The mean individual running velocity of cNMTrun was then used as warm-up and experimental running velocity in 3 subsequent visits, in which subjects ran for 6 minutes on the MT set at different grades (4, 6, or 8%). In all experimental trials (cNMTrun, 4MTrun, 6MTrun, and 8MTrun) and in the warm-up of the subjects' third visit (1MTrun), oxygen consumption (V̇o2) and heart rate (HR) were monitored, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were obtained. The HR in cNMTrun was significantly higher compared with all MT trials. V̇o2 and RPE were significantly higher in cNMTrun compared with 1MTrun and 4MTrun, but not different from 6MTrun and 8MTrun. The relationship between V̇o2 and MT grades was highly linear (V̇o2 = 34.36 + 1.7 MT grade; r = 0.99), and using linear interpolation, the concave curved design of the cNMT was estimated to mimic a 6.9 ± 3% MT grade. On matched running velocities, V̇o2 and RPE responses while running on the cNMT are similar to a 6-8% MT grade. These findings can be used as a reference value by athletes and coaches in the planning of cNMT training sessions and amend running velocities accordingly. Future studies are needed to determine whether this estimate is similar for female runners, or those of a lower body mass. N=10 (age 22±2 y, height 180±6 cm, mass 77±11 kg)",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To compare the assessment of the maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) in a traditional graded exercise test (GXT) with a 1-km self-paced running test on a nonmotorized treadmill in men and women. Methods: A total of 24 sport-science students (12 women: age 23.7 [7.7] y, body height 1.68 [0.02] m, body mass 66.6 [4.3] kg; 12 men: 22.1 [3.1] y, body height 1.82 [0.06] m, body mass 75.6 [11.0] kg) performed a traditional GXT on a motorized treadmill and a 1-km self-paced running test on a nonmotorized treadmill. VO2max, blood lactate, heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion, together with running velocity and duration at each test, were measured. Results: The main findings of the study were that the 1-km test produced significantly higher VO2max values (53.2 [9.9] vs 51.8 [8.8] mL/kg/min ) and blood lactate concentrations (11.9 [1.8] vs 11.1 [2.2] mmol/L) than the GXT (F≥4.8, P≤.04, η<sup>2</sup>≥.18). However, after controlling for sex, these differences were only present in men (60.6 [8.1] vs 58.1 [8.0] mL/kg/min , P=.027). Peak running velocity was higher in the GXT than in the 1-km test (15.7 [2.7] vs 13.0 [2.8] km/h). Men had higher VO2max values and running velocities than women in both tests. However, men and women used approximately similar pacing strategies during the 1-km test. Conclusions: Higher VO2max values were observed in a 1-km self-paced test than in the GXT. This indicates that a 1-km running test performed on a nonmotorized treadmill could serve as a simple and sport-specific alternative for the assessment of VO2max.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Competitive soccer results in acute physiological and perceptual disturbances lasting up to 96-h, yet multiple games are often played with 72-h rest. Contextual factors influence match activities, impacting the assessment of post-match responses. We assessed the within- and post-match responses to two self-paced simulations (SIM1 and SIM2) in a 72-h period. Method: Eleven male team-sport athletes attended eight consecutive testing sessions after familiarisation. Assessments occurred at pre-, half-time, post- and 2 h post-SIM1, and daily up to four-days after SIM2. Statistics included effect size ± 90% CL comparisons to pre-SIM1 and regression analysis. Results: At half time there was reduced voluntary activation (SIM1: -1.52 ± 1.41 and SIM2: -0.50 ± 0.58) and potentiated twitch torque (SIM1: -0.50 ± 0.37 and SIM2: -0.31 ± 0.37), suggesting central and peripheral fatigue, respectively. The difference in activity profiles between simulations was unclear. Both simulations resulted in acute physiological and perceptual decrements, similar to published data from competitive matches. Higher strength was associated with reduced soreness and fatigue at all time points (range: r = 0.27 to 0.69) and lower peripheral fatigue. vV.O2peak was negatively associated with CK (range: r = -0.28 to -0.70). Conclusion: 72-h recovery is sufficient to maintain activity between simulations. Lower-body strength and aerobic capacity displayed protective effects against post-simulation decrements.
