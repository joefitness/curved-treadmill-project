    "abstract": "<b>BACKGROUND:</b> Studies on rest durations during high-intensity interval training (HIIT) often compare fixed and self-selected (SS) rest allocation approaches.  Frequently, the rest duration under SS conditions is unlimited, leading to  inconsistent total rest durations compared to fixed rest conditions. To address  this limitation, we recently compared fixed and SS rest conditions during cycling  HIIT sessions, while keeping the total rest duration equivalent. However, our  protocol required athletes to divide a long total rest duration (720s) across  nine intervals, which may have been overly cognitively demanding. The current  study aimed to explore the effects of the SS approach with a simplified rest  allocation task on performance, physiological, and psychological outcomes.  <b>METHODS:</b> Following a familiarization session, 24 professional female soccer  players completed two running HIIT sessions on a non-motorized treadmill. Each  session consisted of twelve 15s intervals, divided into three blocks, with the  goal of maximizing the distance covered. In both conditions, the between-interval  rest duration per block amounted to 270s. In the fixed condition, the rest was  uniformly allocated to 90s between each interval, whereas in the SS condition,  the athletes chose how to allocate the entirety of the 270s of rest. We compared  the following outcomes: distance, heart rate, perception of fatigue, effort,  autonomy, enjoyment, boredom, and athletes' preferences. Outcomes were compared  using aggregated measures via paired univariate tests, and across the intervals  via mixed-effects models. <b>RESULTS:</b> We observed comparable results in most  outcomes with the exception of higher autonomy (1-15 points) in the SS condition  (mean difference=2.1, 95%CI (0.9, 3.3) points) and a negligibly higher heart  rate in the SS condition when comparing the observations across intervals  (estimate=2.5, 95%CI (0.9, 4.2) beats X min(-1)). Additionally, participants  chose to rest for longer durations as the block progressed. Finally, the majority  of participants (65%) favored the SS condition. <b>CONCLUSION:</b> This study further  solidifies that SS and fixed approaches with matched total rest durations result  in similar performance, physiological, and psychological responses. This effect  persists even when the total rest duration required to be allocated is relatively  short. Therefore, coaches and trainees can choose either approach based on their  preferences and training goals.",

    "abstract": "Background: The influence of load carriage in operational police officers is not well understood despite a relatively high injury rate. Assessing load related changes in head and torso coordination may provide valuable insight into plausible injury mechanisms. Research question: Do typical police tactical vest loads alter head and torso coordination during running?  Methods: Thirty-eight UK police officers ran at a self-selected pace (>2 ms 1) on a non-motorised treadmill in four vest load conditions (unloaded, and low, high and evenly distributed loads). Peak head and torso tilt, and peak vest displacement were compared between all four conditions. Timings between vest and torso change of direction were compared between the three loaded conditions. The coupling angle between the head and torso calculated using modified vector coding were compared between unloaded and each loaded conditions using Statistical Parametric Mapping. Results: No significant differences were found between conditions for peak head or torso tilt alone (p > 0.05). Loading equipment low on the vest led to significantly greater mediolateral vest displacements (38 mm) away from the torso than a high (34 mm) or evenly distributed (30 mm) conditions. The vest was found to change direction vertically before the torso in the anterior-posterior direction, and then influence torso motion. The loaded conditions changed the head-torso coupling from in-phase (with head-dominancy) to anti-phase (with torso dominancy) between 55% and 77% stance. Anti-phase with a relatively stationary head and the torso rotating forward likely places a greater concentric demand on the posterior neck muscles relative to unloaded running. Significance: Current tactical vest designs allow significant extra displacement of load away from the body during running, altering coordination at the head and torso. N = 38 (24 males (M); age (years) M 44 \u00b1 7, F 40 \u00b1 9)",

Thirty-eight athletes aged 17 to 25 years old participated in the study, including 18 with a history of concussion. The dual-task paradigm required walking continuously at a predetermined self-paced target speed of 6.5 km/h while executing a complex switch task. Athletes completed two conditions, each on separate days: (1) dual task alone and (2) dual task following 20 min of running on a non-motorized treadmill. The statistical analyses revealed a significant reduction in gait speed exclusively for athletes with a history of concussion and only following the post-exercise condition (p = 0.008). These findings suggest that although asymptomatic concussed athletes maintain a cognitive performance comparable to non-concussed athletes, this appears to be achieved at the expense of gait speed. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating gait assessments and post-exercise exertion into concussion evaluation protocols in both research and clinical settings.",

However, in many settings, the 30-m corridor required to conduct the test may not be available. Evaluation of the use of a non-motorized treadmill as an alternative method has not been well studied. <b>PURPOSE:</b> This study compared the distances walked during the traditional (TRAD) 6MWT on a flat indoor surface to a non-motorized treadmill (NMT) to validate the use of the NMT as an alternative testing method. <b>METHODS:</b> A total of 55 healthy adults (28 females) completed the TRAD 6MWT and NMT 6MWT during the same testing session (randomized order). The levels of agreement between the two methods were quantified using Lin's concordance correlation coefficients. Additionally, a multiple linear regression was developed to predict TRAD 6MWT distance with covariates age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) from NMT distance walked. <b>RESULTS:</b> The average TRAD distance walked was 630 m and the average NMT distance walked was 607 m. The mean difference of 23 m between the two methods was nonsignificant. There was good agreement between methods (rc = 0.84) showing no differences. A multiple linear regression was developed and revealed that NMT distance significantly predicted TRAD distance when controlling for age, sex, height, and weight (Standardized Beta = 0.791, p < 0.001). <b>CONCLUSION:</b> The use of the NMT for 6MWT was deemed a valid and feasible replacement for the TRAD 6MWT based on the results of this study.

    "abstract": "Walking is a common and preferred form of exercise. Although there are current recommendations for walking volume (e.g., steps per day), recent research has begun to distinguish volume from intensity (e.g., \u201cbrisk\u201d walking) as an important dimension of exercise. Increasing intensity may confer health advantages beyond volume measures because it shifts cardiovascular performance to more vigorous training zones. Reinforcement-based approaches have been valuable in increasing volume measures of exercise, and the present study sought to develop a corresponding reinforcement approach to training walking intensity. For this study, we used a continuous reinforcement paradigm where music played only while walking met specified criteria; otherwise, music playback stopped. As a result, music was synchronized with walking performance. Seventeen participants walked on a nonmotorized treadmill at a self-selected pace. Across the session, different conditions arranged for music to play independent of walking speed or contingent on speed increases or decreases. An extinction component assessed performance when music was withdrawn completely. Walking speed was selectively increased and decreased by adjusting the contingencies that were arranged for music, and variability in speed increased during extinction, with both findings indicating that music was a reinforcer. Heart rate was also increased to moderate-vigorous intensities during reinforcement. The findings provide a compelling case that walking intensity can be modified by music reinforcement. We suggest that synchronous schedules may be an important foundation for future exercise technologies that are based on reinforcement. N=17 Women (mean age = 22)",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if curved non-motorized treadmills can reproduce overground running better than motorized treadmills by analysing the differences in joint kinematics (hip, knee, and ankle) using SPM. Nineteen recreational runners completed three randomized running tests on these surfaces. Kinematic data from the hip, knee, and ankle joints were collected. Two-tailed SPM t-tests were performed to analyse time-continuous gait cycles in three anatomical planes of each joint. Higher within-subject variability was observed in the frontal and transverse planes during curved non-motorized treadmill running. SPM analysis showed more significant differences (p < 0.05) between curved nonmotorized treadmill and overground than between motorized treadmill and overground, mainly in knee (from 12% to 30% and 93% to 99% of the gait cycle) and ankle (from 19% to 23% of the gait cycle) in the sagittal plane. Therefore, running on curved non-motorized treadmills is more biomechanically different compared to overground than motorized treadmills, and might not be the best strategy to replicate overground running in terms of joint kinematics during highly controlled research studies. However, they could be an interesting tool in rehabilitation or training environments since the changes observed in joint kinematics were likely not functionally relevant.

These differences between the running surfaces may affect impact accelerations during prolonged running. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of the type of running surface (motorised treadmill (MT), curved non-motorised treadmill (cNMT), and overground (OVG)) and prolonged running in impact accelerations, spatiotemporal parameters and perceptual variables. In the current study, twenty-one recreational runners completed three randomised crossover prolonged running test on these surfaces consisting of a 30-minute run at 80% of the individual maximal aerobic speed. A two-way repeated-measure analysis of variance, with the level of significance set at p < 0.05, showed a reduction in impact accelerations, such as tibia peak acceleration, when running on cNMT vs MT (p = 0.001, ES = 4.2) or OVG (p = 0.004, ES = 2.9). Running on cNMT produced an increase in stride frequency (p = 0.023, ES = 0.9) and higher rating of perceived effort (p < 0.001, ES = 8.9) and heart rate (p = 0.001, ES = 2.9) compared to OVG, with no differences between treadmills. These findings suggest that impact accelerations, spatiotemporal parameters, rating of perceived exertion and heart rate are different between the surfaces analysed, what should be taken into consideration when running on these surfaces.

    "abstract": "Soccer is a fast-growing area of research, demonstrated by a 10-fold increase in the number of PubMed articles derived from the search term 'soccer' between 2001 and 2021. The scope of contemporary soccer-related articles ranges from match-play observations to laboratory evaluations of performance. The activity profile of soccer match-play is variable and techniques to collect data within matches are limited. Soccer-specific simulations have been developed to simulate the evolving demands of match-play. The evolutionary designs of novel simulations provide a reproducible exercise stimulus for varying researcher and practitioner objectives. The applied researcher can utilise simulations to investigate the efficacy of nutritional interventions and environmental stress on performance, while assessing the physiological and biomechanical responses to representations of match-play. Practitioners can adopt simulations for rehabilitation to progressively facilitate return-to-play processes, while implementing extra top-up conditioning sessions for unused and partial-match players. However, there are complexities involved with the selection of varying simulations which are dependent on the research question or practical application. There also remains a paucity of published information to support researchers and practitioners in selecting from differing simulation models. To assist with researcher and practitioner interpretations, we present a commentary of the current simulations to inform decision-making processes for research and training purposes and enhance the application of future research. An objective scoring system was adopted for rating the research and practical applications of each simulation design. Overall scores of 22, 16 and 18 out of 36 were revealed for free-running (n = 7), non-motorised- (n = 4) and motorised-treadmill-based simulations (n = 4), respectively.",

It remains unclear how sports participation influences running biomechanics in individuals with FAIS.  <b>Hypothesis:</b> Changes in running biomechanics and/or isometric hip strength after repeated sprint exercise would be greatest in individuals with FAIS compared with asymptomatic individuals with (CAM) and without cam morphology (Control). <b>Study Design:</b> Controlled laboratory study.  <b>Level of Evidence:</b> Level 3. <b>Methods:</b> Three-dimensional hip biomechanics during maximal running (10 m) and hip strength were measured in 49 recreationally active individuals (FAIS = 15; CAM = 16; Control = 18) before and after repeated sprint exercise performed on a nonmotorized treadmill (8-16 x 30 m). Effects of group and time were assessed for biomechanics and strength variables with repeated-measures analyses of variance. Relationships between hip pain (Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score) and changes in hip moments and strength after repeated sprint exercise were determined using Spearman's correlation coefficients (ρ). <b>Results:</b> Running speed, hip flexion angles, hip flexion and extension moments, and hip strength in all muscle groups were significantly reduced from pre to post. No significant between-group differences were observed before or after repeated sprint exercise. No significant relationships (ρ = 0.04-0.30) were observed between hip pain and changes in hip moments or strength in the FAIS group. <b>Conclusion:</b> Changes in running biomechanics and strength after repeated sprint exercise did not differ between participants with FAIS and asymptomatic participants with and without cam morphology. Self-reported pain did not appear to influence biomechanics during running or strength after repeated sprint exercise in participants with FAIS. <b>Clinical Relevance:</b> A short bout of repeated sprinting may not elicit changes in running biomechanics in FAIS beyond what occurs in those without symptoms.

This study aimed to assess IMU measurement accuracy during high-speed running and maximal effort sprinting on a curved non-motorized treadmill using discrete (Bland-Altman analysis) and continuous (root mean square error [RMSE], normalised RMSE, Pearson correlation, and statistical parametric mapping analysis [SPM]) metrics. The hip, knee, and ankle flexions and the pelvic orientation (tilt, obliquity, and rotation) were captured concurrently from both IMU and optical motion capture systems, as 20 participants ran steadily at 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% of their maximal effort sprinting speed (5.36 ± 0.55, 6.02 ± 0.60, 6.66 ± 0.71, and 7.09 ± 0.73 m/s, respectively). Bland-Altman analysis indicated a systematic bias within ±1◦ for the peak pelvic tilt, rotation, and lower-limb kinematics and -3.3◦ to -4.1◦ for the pelvic obliquity. The SPM analysis demonstrated a good agreement in the hip and knee flexion angles for most phases of the stride cycle, albeit with significant differences noted around the ipsilateral toe-off. The RMSE ranged from 4.3◦ (pelvic obliquity at 70% speed) to 7.8◦ (hip flexion at 100% speed). Correlation coefficients ranged from 0.44 (pelvic tilt at 90%) to 0.99 (hip and knee flexions at all speeds). Running speed minimally but significantly affected the RMSE for the hip and ankle flexions. The present IMU system is effective for measuring lower-limb kinematics during sprinting, but the pelvic orientation estimation was less accurate. N=20 (14 males, 6 females; age: 26.8 ± 5.5 years)",

Twenty-six recreationally active men (n = 12) and women (n = 14) between the ages of 18 and 35 years old (21.5 ± 2.4 years) completed the 30nmt at 9:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 7:00 PM in a randomized order over a 24-hour period. Resting heart rate and temperature assessments were taken at each visit. A dietary recall and the Morningness Eveningness Questionnaire were used to assess kilocalories (kcals) and chronotype, respectively. Two-way (time x sex) repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted to determine differences in peak/mean power, peak/mean velocity, distance, resting heart rate, temperature, and kcals at each time point. Paired sample t tests were used to assess peak and nadir of each performance variable. A significance level was set at p , 0.05. There was a significant main effect for temperature (p < 0.001), resting heart rate (p = 0.007), and pre-exercise caloric intake (p = 0.021) throughout the day. No significant main effects for time were found for peak power (p = 0.766), mean power (p = 0.094), peak velocity (p = 0.497), mean velocity (p = 0.193), or distance (p = 0.262).

    "abstract": "An increase in the popularity of running can be seen over the last decades, with a large number of injuries on it. Most of the running injuries are related to impact accelerations and are due to overuse. In order to reduce the risk of injury or to improve performance and health new treadmill designs have been created, as it can be the curved non-motorized treadmill. The aim of this study was to analyse impact accelerations, spatio-temporal parameters and perceptual differences while running on curved non-motorized treadmill (cNMT) compared to motorized treadmill (MT) at different speeds. Therefore, 27 recreational runners completed two tests consisting of 10 min warm-up and three bouts of 8 min running at 2.77 m/s, 3.33 m/s and self-selected speed on cNMT and MT, previously randomised. Although the surface did not influence spatio-temporal parameters, a reduction in impact accelerations, head acceleration rate (mean effect size [ES] = 0.86), tibia peak (mean ES = 0.45) and tibia magnitude (mean ES = 0.55), was observed while running on cNMT in comparison with running on MT. Moreover, higher heart rate (HR) (mean ES = 0.51) and rating of perceived effort (RPE) (mean ES = 0.34) were found while running on cNMT. These findings demonstrated that higher intensity training and lower impact accelerations are experimented on cNMT, what can be used by trainers and athletes while planning training sessions. N = 27 (22 males and 5 females; age 25 ± 7 years)",

Three-dimensional kinematics and ground reaction forces  were subsequently recorded during a 10-metre maximal overground sprint before and immediately after the repeated running protocol, from which we calculated work done by sagittal plane hip, knee, and ankle moments. Relative work (J/kg) was reported as a percentage of positive and negative work done  by the sum of joint moments. <b>Results:</b> Following the repeated running protocol, maximal sprint speed decreased by 19% and was  accompanied by reductions in total positive (-1.47 J/kg) and negative (-0.92 J/kg) work, in addition to  work done by hip (-0.43 to -0.82 J/kg) and knee (-0.28 J/kg) moments during swing. Compared to before the repeated running protocol, less relative work was done by hip extension (-9%) and knee flexion/extension (-3%) moments during swing. Reductions in work done by hip and knee joint moments during swing were significantly correlated with reductions in maximum running speed (r=0.61-0.89, p<0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> A sports-specific repeated sprint protocol resulted in reductions in mechanical work done by sagittal plane hip and knee joint moments during maximal overground sprinting. Interventions focused on maintaining positive work done by the hip flexors/extensors and negative work done by knee flexors/extensors during the swing phase of running may help prevent reductions in speed following repeated sprinting.

The research was carried out in the “Planica Nordic Centre—PNC” in the wind tunnel system, where the AirRunner Assault treadmill, which was equipped with four sensors measuring the vertical and horizontal ground reaction forces, was installed. To obtain biokinetic data, the runners performed the treadmill's run under conditions of airflow directed at each participant's back (backwind speeds +3 m/s and +5 m/s) and the chest (headwind speeds -5 m/s and -7 m/s). The runner's speed was measured via image analysis using a DSLR camera and markers on the belt of the treadmill. Additionally, a high-speed camera synchronised to the force acquisition system was used to analyse the contact phase via comparison of foot placement and time series of the ground reaction forces. The contact phases of the running step were found to be longer than the flight phases, with their duration ranging from 0.15 to 0.20 s and the maximum forces at take-off were found to be greater than when running with the backwind. It should be noted that the application of high-tech devices wind tunnel and treadmill were found to be sufficiently accurate to perform kinetic measurements of running parameters in changing conditions, such as resistance and assistance (facilitating).

This study investigated the effect of discontinuous, running-based RSH, on repeated-sprint treadmill performance in hypoxia in a team sport cohort, prior to international competition. Over a 6-week “in-season” period, 11 elite male players (Malaysia national team) completed eight multi-set RSH sessions on a non-motorized treadmill in a normobaric hypoxic chamber (FiO<sub>2</sub> = 13.8%). Three testing sessions (Sessions 1, 5, and 8), involved three sets of 5 x 8-s sprints, with 52-s recovery between sprints and 4-5 min between sets. Training sessions (Sessions 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7) consisted of four to five sets of 4-5 x 8-s sprints. During testing sessions, maximum sprinting speed was recorded for each sprint with values averaged for each set. For each set, a peak speed and fatigue index were calculated. Data were compared using two-way repeated measures ANOVA (sessions x sets). Average speed per set increased between testing sessions (p = 0.001, η<sup>2</sup>p = 0.49), with higher values in Session 8 (25.1 ± 0.9 km•h<sup>-1</sup>, +4 ± 3%, p = 0.005), but not Session 5 (24.8 ± 1.0 km•h<sup>-1</sup>, +3 ± 3%, p = 0.405), vs. Session 1 (24.2 ± 1.5 km•h<sup>-1</sup>). Peak sprinting speed in each set also increased across testing sessions (p = 0.008, η<sup>2</sup>p = 0.382), with Session 8 (26.5 ± 1.1 km•h<sup>-1</sup>) higher than Session 5 (25.8 ± 1.0 km•h<sup>-1</sup>, +1 ± 4%, p = 0.06) and Session 1 (25.7 ± 1.5 km•h<sup>-1</sup>, +4 ± 4%, p = 0.034).

This study evaluated the effect of virtual reality gait training (VRGT) with non-motorized treadmill on balance and gait ability of elderly individuals who had experienced a fall. Fifty-six elderly individuals living in local communities participated in this study. Subjects who met the selection criteria were randomly divided into a VRGT group (n = 28) and a control group (n = 28). The VRGT group received VRGT with non-motorized treadmill for 50 min a day for 4 weeks and 5 days a week. The control group received non-motorized treadmill gait training without virtual reality for the same amount of time as the VRGT group. Before and after the training, the one-leg-standing test, Berg Balance Scale, Functional Reach test, and Timed Up and Go test were used to assess balance ability, and the gait analyzer system was used to evaluate the improvement in gait spatiotemporal parameters. In the VRGT group, the balance ability variable showed a significant decrease in the one-leg-standing test and a significant improvement in the Timed Up and Go test. With respect to spatiotemporal gait parameters, velocity and step width decreased significantly in the VRGT group (p < 0.05), and stride length and step length were significantly improved in the VRGT group (p < 0.05). VRGT with non-motorized treadmill has been shown to improve balance and gait ability in the elderly.

Fourteen male team-sport athletes performed 2 randomly ordered testing sessions on a nonmotorized treadmill with one session requiring subjects to decelerate (TMd) within 4 seconds before stopping or immediately step to the side of the treadmill belt at the completion of each sprint (TMa). Peak and mean velocities, speed decrement, blood lactate concentrations, and oxygen uptake were monitored during the repeated-sprint running protocols. Countermovement vertical jump (CMJ) performance, perceived muscle soreness, sit-and-reach flexibility, plasma creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and myoglobin (Mb) concentrations were quantified immediately before and after and 45 minutes, 24 and 48 hours after repeated-sprint running protocols. Although muscle damage was indicated by increases in CK, LDH, and Mb (p ≤ 0.05) in both groups, there was no significant effect of condition (TMa vs. TMd) on any of the measured performance or physiological variables (p > 0.05). The present study indicated that the removal of deceleration from repeated-sprint running on a nonmotorized treadmill has no effect on metabolism or performance during or after repeated-sprint running or markers of muscle damage.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate and systematically review the evidence relating to time-of-day based on performance measures in repeated-sprints. The entire content of PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, SPORTDiscus® (via EBSCOhost) and Web of Science was searched. Only experimental research studies conducted in male adult participants aged ≥18yrs, published in English before June 2019 were included. Studies assessing repeatedsprints between a minimum of two time-points during the day (morning versus evening) were deemed eligible. The primary search revealed that a total of 10 out of 112 articles were considered eligible and subsequently included. Seven articles were deemed strong and three moderate quality. Eight studies found repeated-sprint performance across the first, first few, or all sprints, to increase in favor of the evening. The magnitude of difference is dependent on the modality and the exercise protocol used. The non-motorized treadmill established an average 3.5-8.5% difference in distance covered, average and peak velocity, and average power, across all sprints in three studies and in peak power in two studies. In cycling, power output differed across all sprints by 6.0% in one study and 8.0% for the first sprint only in five studies. All four studies measuring power decrement values (i.e. rate of fatigue) established differences up to 4.0% and two out of five studies established total work to be significantly higher by 8.0%. Repeated-sprint performance is affected by time-of-day with greater performance in the late/ early afternoon. The magnitude is dependent on the variable assessed and the mode of exercise. There is a clear demand for more rigorous investigations which control factors that specifically relate to investigations of time-of-day and are specific to the sport of individuals.",

J Strength Cond Res 34(5): 1197-1200, 2020—The current study compared the physiological and perceptual demands of running on a commercially available curved nonmotorized treadmill (cNMT) with different incline grades on a motorized treadmill (MT). Ten male team-sport athletes completed, after a familiarization session, a 6-minute run at a target velocity of 2.78 m·s<sup>-1</sup> on the cNMT (cNMTrun). The mean individual running velocity of cNMTrun was then used as warm-up and experimental running velocity in 3 subsequent visits, in which subjects ran for 6 minutes on the MT set at different grades (4, 6, or 8%). In all experimental trials (cNMTrun, 4MTrun, 6MTrun, and 8MTrun) and in the warm-up of the subjects' third visit (1MTrun), oxygen consumption (V̇o2) and heart rate (HR) were monitored, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were obtained. The HR in cNMTrun was significantly higher compared with all MT trials. V̇o2 and RPE were significantly higher in cNMTrun compared with 1MTrun and 4MTrun, but not different from 6MTrun and 8MTrun. The relationship between V̇o2 and MT grades was highly linear (V̇o2 = 34.36 + 1.7 MT grade; r = 0.99), and using linear interpolation, the concave curved design of the cNMT was estimated to mimic a 6.9 ± 3% MT grade. On matched running velocities, V̇o2 and RPE responses while running on the cNMT are similar to a 6-8% MT grade. These findings can be used as a reference value by athletes and coaches in the planning of cNMT training sessions and amend running velocities accordingly. Future studies are needed to determine whether this estimate is similar for female runners, or those of a lower body mass. N=10 (age 22±2 y, height 180±6 cm, mass 77±11 kg)",

VO2max, blood lactate, heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion, together with running velocity and duration at each test, were measured. <b>Results:</b> The main findings of the study were that the 1-km test produced significantly higher VO2max values (53.2 [9.9] vs 51.8 [8.8] mL/kg/min ) and blood lactate concentrations (11.9 [1.8] vs 11.1 [2.2] mmol/L) than the GXT (F≥4.8, P≤.04, η<sup>2</sup>≥.18). However, after controlling for sex, these differences were only present in men (60.6 [8.1] vs 58.1 [8.0] mL/kg/min , P=.027). Peak running velocity was higher in the GXT than in the 1-km test (15.7 [2.7] vs 13.0 [2.8] km/h). Men had higher VO2max values and running velocities than women in both tests. However, men and women used approximately similar pacing strategies during the 1-km test. <b>Conclusions:</b> Higher VO2max values were observed in a 1-km self-paced test than in the GXT.

Contextual factors influence match activities, impacting the assessment of post-match responses. We assessed the within- and post-match responses to two self-paced simulations (SIM1 and SIM2) in a 72-h period. <b>Method:</b> Eleven male team-sport athletes attended eight consecutive testing sessions after familiarisation. Assessments occurred at pre-, half-time, post- and 2 h post-SIM1, and daily up to four-days after SIM2. Statistics included effect size ± 90% CL comparisons to pre-SIM1 and regression analysis. <b>Results:</b> At half time there was reduced voluntary activation (SIM1: -1.52 ± 1.41 and SIM2: -0.50 ± 0.58) and potentiated twitch torque (SIM1: -0.50 ± 0.37 and SIM2: -0.31 ± 0.37), suggesting central and peripheral fatigue, respectively. The difference in activity profiles between simulations was unclear. Both simulations resulted in acute physiological and perceptual decrements, similar to published data from competitive matches. Higher strength was associated with reduced soreness and fatigue at all time points (range: r = 0.27 to 0.69) and lower peripheral fatigue. vV.O2peak was negatively associated with CK (range: r = -0.28 to -0.70). <b>Conclusion:</b> 72-h recovery is sufficient to maintain activity between simulations. Lower-body strength and aerobic capacity displayed protective effects against post-simulation decrements.

Furthermore, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (0.846) demonstrated that the between-leg difference in mean horizontal force was a good instrument for identifying previous hamstring injury. <b>Conclusions</b> There is a greater fatigued-induced change in mean horizontal force during a repeated-sprint test in legs with previous hamstring injury than the non-injured legs of the injured players or the legs of uninjured players. Such asymmetry may contribute to impaired performance in football players returning from hamstring injury and also to the high rate of hamstring re-injury. Rehabilitation and return-to-play strategies should emphasise a reduction in asymmetry, particularly during repeated high-intensity efforts.

In four subsequent visits, participants performed a HIIT session comprising six 4-min work intervals, in which the recovery duration between work intervals equalled either a fixed (1MIN, 2MIN, 3MIN) or a self-selected duration (ssMIN). HIIT sessions were run on a non-motorized treadmill, and were performed under isoeffort conditions. <b>Results</b> Mean running velocity was significantly higher in 3MIN compared with all other protocols, and higher in ssMIN compared with 2MIN. No significant differences in time spent ≥90% and 95% VO<sub>2max</sub>, or ≥90% and 95% HRmax were evident between the four protocols. RPE responses were similar across and within the protocols showing a gradual increase with each progressive interval. <b>Conclusion</b> In a self-paced HIIT session of six 4-min work intervals, the length of recovery durations had a limited effect on the total physiological strain endured in the training. However, running velocities were higher when participants received the longest recovery period (3MIN). Longer recovery durations may facilitate a higher external training load (faster running), whilst maintaining a similar internal training load (physiological stimulus), and may therefore allow for greater training adaptations.

    "abstract": "There are a wide range of options for individuals to choose from in order to engage in aerobic exercise; from outdoor running to computer controlled and self-propelled treadmills. Recently, self-propelled treadmills have increased in popularity and provide an alternative to a motorized treadmill. Twenty subjects (10 men, 10 women) ranging in age from 19-23 with a mean of 20.4 ± 0.8 SD were participants in this study. The subjects visited the laboratory on three occasions. The purpose of the first visit was to familiarize the subject with the self-propelled treadmill (Woodway Curve 3.0). The second visit, subjects were instructed to run on the selfpropelled treadmill for 3km at a self-determined pace. Speed data were collected directly from the self-propelled treadmill. The third visit used speed data collected during the self-propelled treadmill run to create an identically paced 3km run for the subjects to perform on a motorized treadmill (COSMED T150). During both the second and third visit, oxygen consumption (VO2) and respiratory exchange ratio (R) data were collected with COSMED's Quark cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) metabolic mixing chamber system. The VO2 mean value for the self-propelled treadmill (44.90 ± 1.65 SE ml/kg/min) was significantly greater than the motorized treadmill (34.38 ± 1.39 SE ml/kg/min). The mean R value for the self-propelled treadmill (0.91 ± 0.01 SE) was significantly greater than the motorized treadmill (0.86 ± 0.01 SE). Our study demonstrated that a 3km run on a selfpropelled treadmill does elicit a greater physiological response than a 3km run at on a standard motorized treadmill. Self-propelled treadmills provide a mode of exercise that offers increased training loads and should be considered as an alternative to motorized treadmills.",

A possible solution may lie with novel nonmotorized treadmill (NMT) devices as the belt surface is propelled by the user. <b>Objective:</b> The purpose of this study was to compare gait performance during both MT and NMT locomotion to OG. <b>Design:</b> Crossover study. <b>Setting:</b> A university research laboratory. <b>Patients:</b> A total of 20 healthy adults (10 women) participated in the study. <b>Intervention:</b> Each participant performed self-selected walking and running OG, and on both an MT and NMT. <b>Main Outcome Measure:</b> Shoulder, trunk, and lower-extremity kinematics were analyzed for each treadmill condition and compared to OG. <b>Results:</b> The analyses demonstrated that there were no differences between MT and OG gait kinematics during either walking or running. However, NMT gait showed increased hip, knee, and ankle flexions in late swing and early stance compared to OG during both walking and running. For example, during walking, the NMT elicited hip-, knee-, and ankle-flexion/extension angles of 34.7°, 8.0°, and 3.6° at foot strike compared to 24.8°, -3.1°, and -5.8° in the OG condition (P < .05). There was also a significant reduction in trunkflexion/extension range of motion during running compared to OG (7.7° in NMT vs 9.8° in OG). <b>Conclusions:</b> These differences may have implications for both training and rehabilitation on an NMT. Future studies should consider the influence of NMT familiarization on gait performance and should emphasize the assessment of neuromuscular performance.

It is not known, though, whether the change in gait carries over to running on a motorized treadmill on level ground. To determine the effect of running on a curved non-motorized treadmill (CNT) on gait characteristics, measured during a subsequent bout of running on a traditional motorized treadmill (TMT), sixteen healthy college-aged participants, aged (mean ± SD) 20.4 ± 1.6 years, volunteered to have their gait analyzed while running on a TMT and CNT. After familiarization with, and a warm-up on, both treadmills, each subject completed five 4-min bouts of running, alternating between traditional motorized and curved non-motorized treadmills: TMT-1, CNT-1, TMT-2, CNT-2, and TMT-3. Variables of interest included step length (m), stride length (m), imbalance score (%), and stride angle (◦), and were measured using Optogait gait analysis equipment. We found differences in gait characteristics among TMT-1, TMT-2, and TMT-3, which can be attributed to running on the CNT. The results show that running on a CNT resulted in significant changes in gait characteristics (step length, stride length, imbalance score and stride angle). These findings suggest that running on a CNT can significantly influence running gait.",

To address this, the biological, perceptual, and performance responses were assessed using a self-paced, simulated soccer match protocol using a nonmotorized treadmill. Twelve male team-sport athletes performed the 90-minute simulation. Match activity, quadriceps twitch interpolation (voluntary activation [%VA] and potentiated twitch [POT]), biochemical markers, strength and power performance, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and self-report wellness were collected prematch, halftime, postmatch, and 2, 24, 48, 72, and 96-hour postmatch. Change compared with prematch was calculated using effect size ±90% confidence limit, and relationships were assessed using regression analysis. Subjects covered 12,445.8 ± 768.7 m at 87.1 ± 3.2% maximal heart rate (mean ± SD). Reductions in %VA and POT was present at halftime (-0.38 ± 0.46 and -0.79 ± 0.30, respectively) and persisted postmatch.

High-speed running correlated with soreness (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.42) and  very high-speed running with reduced POT (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.61).

Ten male runners experienced in road racing who had never run on an NMT completed 3 TT to establish personal best 5-km pace. In a later session, participants ran at this pace for 5 minutes on the NMT while metabolic, gait, and perceptual measures were recorded and then ran at outdoor 5-km personal best pace on an MT at 1% grade (counter-balanced crossover design). Intraclass correlation (ICC = 0.95) between the TT1 and TT2 was strong but improved between TT2 and TT3 (ICC = 0.99) with considerable reduction in variability. Nonmotorized treadmill resulted in a 24% slower pace (10.6 ± 1.5 vs. 13.9 ± 2.6 km·h<sup>-1</sup>; p < 0.001), shorter stride length (1.02 ± 0.10 vs. 1.27 ± 0.18 m; p < 0.001), and decreased cadence (175 ± 12 vs. 181 ± 13 steps per·minute; p = 0.01).

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the cardiometabolic demands of running on a curved non-motorized treadmill (cNMT) with overground (OVR) and motorized treadmill (MOT) running. Fourteen trained male (n = 7) and female (n = 7) runners (VO<sub>2</sub>peak 56.6 ± 4.0 mL.kg<sup>-1</sup>•min<sup>-1</sup>) participated in the study. Each experimental session consisted of 5 x 6-min bouts of running at progressively higher speeds, separated by 6-min rest (females 9-15 km•h<sup>-1</sup>; males 10.5-16.5 km•h<sup>-1</sup>). Oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) and heart rate (HR) during the last 2 min of each bout were measured using a portable metabolic cart. Running at a set speed on the cNMT required a higher percentage of VO<sub>2</sub>peak than OVR (mean ± 90% CI, 22 ± 6%; ES ± 90% CI, 1.87 ± 0.15) and MOT (16 ± 6%; ES 1.50 ± 0.15) running. Similarly, HR during the cNMT was higher compared to OVR (25 ± 9 beats•min<sup>-1</sup>, ES 1.23 ± 0.14) and MOT (22 ± 9 beats•min<sup>-1</sup>, ES 1.35 ± 0.13) trials. The decline in running economy observed during the cNMT trial was negatively related to body mass (R<sup>2</sup> 0.493, P = 0.01), indicating lighter runners were required to work at a higher relative intensity to overcome treadmill belt resistance. These data demonstrate the higher cardiometabolic demand associated with running at a given speed on the cNMT. It is critical these differences are taken into account when prescribing training intensities on the cNMT or translating data from the laboratory to an athletic setting.",

    "abstract": "It is generally believed that running on a curved surface is more unstable than running on a flat surface. In this study, the dynamic stability of locomotion on a nonmotorized curved treadmill (NMCT) with three curvature radii was compared with that on a motorized flat treadmill. Sixteen healthy adult men maintained four different self-paced speeds: slow walking, fast walking, jogging, and running. Significant differences were statistically verified using two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) according to the curvature radii and speeds, and the interaction effects were confirmed. Furthermore, to understand the significant differences between the speed and curvature radius, post hoc analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA. Except for the step width, the other parameters showed differences and correlation effects between the curvature radius and speed. As the curvature radius decreased, the stability decreased at slow speeds (slow walking) but increased at fast speeds (running). However, as the curvature radius increased, the stability increased at slow speeds (slow walking) but decreased at high speeds (running). The study results will help in suggesting the appropriate curvature radius for different user types such as athletes, the elderly, and people who require rehabilitation and will serve as preliminary data for designing the curvature radii of NMCTs.",

    "abstract": "Understanding dynamic stability during locomotion is very important for preventing falling and injury. Although many previous studies have investigated dynamic stability characteristics under self-paced speed (SP) and fixed-speed (FS) conditions, very few have directly compared the two conditions. In this study, the margin of stability (MOS) was evaluated under the SP and FS conditions using a nonmotorized curved treadmill (NMCT). Interaction effects were found between the curvature radius and speed, the differences between each curvature radius and speed were confirmed, and significant differences were found between the SP and FS conditions. According to experimental results, under both the SP and FS conditions, the dynamic stability increased with the curvature radius during slow and fast walking. However, under the SP condition, as the curvature radius increased, the MOS in the anteroposterior direction decreased during running; however, under the FS condition, no distinctive trend was observed. At most curvature radii and speeds, significant differences were found between the SP and FS conditions. The study results indicated that while exercising on the NMCT, the SP and FS conditions at different curvature radii and speeds could influence the dynamic stability. The results could be utilized for verifying exercise capacity enhancement and rehabilitation exercise effects.",

As a walkway, the top surface of its belt has U-shaped concave sag that enables the belt to rotate freely through human footsteps. The concave sag on the upper belt is produced by also allowing the unnecessary sag on the lower belt, which is yet to be known. This study suggests a design method for the curved treadmill accompanied by a mathematical model that enables the prediction of the exact extent of the upper and lower belt sags according to design factors. The mathematical model is presented using the approximated parabola curve instead of the catenary curve, the belt tension, and the wheel friction. An experimental belt system is produced. The extent of the upper and lower belt sags is also measured to compare with the calculated values from algebraic expressions. The theoretical values match the actual measurements, which confirm the validity of the mathematical model.

Fourteen male participants (22.4 ± 1.6yrs; 76.4 ± 8.7kg; 1.80 ± 0.07 m); (7 EVH+ve; 7 EVH-ve) were recruited following written informed consent. All participants undertook an EVH challenge to identify either EVH+ve ( ↓ FEV<sub>1</sub>>10%) or EVH-ve ( ↓ FEV<sub>1</sub><10%). Participants performed three separate 3 km running time-trials in a low-humidity (20-25%) environment on a non-motorized treadmill, 15 minutes following inhalation of salbutamol (400 μg), placebo (non-active inhalant) or control (no inhalant), in a randomized, single-blind, repeated measures design. Forced vital capacity maneuvers were performed at baseline, 10 minutes post inhalation and post time-trial. Time to complete 3 km and lung function data were analyzed using mixed model repeated measures ANOVA. Significance was assumed at p < 0.05. All EVH+ve participants had FEV<sub>1</sub> falls from baseline between 10-25% post-challenge. There was no difference in performance time between trial conditions in EVH+ve (1012.7 ± 129.6s; 1002.4 ± 123.1s; 1015.9 ± 113.0s) (p = 0.774) and EVH-ve (962.1 ± 99.2s; 962.0 ± 76.2s; 950.8 ± 84.9s) (p = 0.401) groups for salbutamol, placebo and control trials, respectively. Exercising heart rate was significantly higher  (p = 0.05) in the salbutamol trial (183 ± 8 beats•min <sup>-1</sup>) compared  to control (180 ± 9 beats•min<sup>-1</sup>) with a trend towards significance (p=0.06) in the placebo trial (179 ± 9 beats•min<sup>-1</sup>) for the pooled groups, no differences were seen between trials in groups individually. There was an increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> in both EVH+ve (4.01 ± 0.8L; 4.26 ± 0.7L; 4.25 ± 0.5L) and EVH-ve (4.81 ± 0.4L; 5.1 ± 0.4L; 5.1 ± 0.5L) groups which was significant postinhalation (p = 0.01; p = 0.02), but not post-time-trial (p = 0.27; p = 0.06), respectively, following salbutamol. EVH+ve participants did not demonstrate significant falls (>10% from baseline) in FEV<sub>1</sub> following any time-trial.

The study's aim was to develop 'CI2' as a method to calculate the CI on time-series bivariate  plots, and to identify if the CI between two bivariate time-series overlap. The test data were the knee and ankle  angles from 10 healthy participants running on a motorised standard-treadmill and non-motorised curvedtreadmill. For a recommended 10+ trials, CI2 involved calculating 95% confidence-ellipses at each time-point,  then taking as the CI the points on the ellipses that were perpendicular to the direction vector between the  means of two adjacent time-points. Consecutive pairs of CI created convex quadrilaterals, and any overlap of  these quadrilaterals at the same time or ±1 frame as a time-lag calculated using cross-correlations, indicated  where the two time-series differed. CI2 showed no group differences between left and right legs on both  treadmills, but the same legs between treadmills for all participants showed differences of less knee extension  on the curved-treadmill before heel-strike. To improve and standardise the use of CI2 it is recommended to  remove outlier time-series, use 95% confidence-ellipses, and scale the ellipse by the fixed Chi-square value  as opposed to the sample-size dependent F-value. For practical use, and to aid in standardisation or future  development of CI2, Matlab code is provided. CI2 provides an effective method to quantify the CI of bivariate  plots, and to explore the differences in CI between two bivariate time-series. N=10 Males (21.4±4.1years; 75.6±7.0kg; 1.81±0.08m)",

Nine trained male runners completed familiarisation and three randomised 5 km running time trials on a non-motorised treadmill in the heat (33°C).

Temperature, cardiorespiratory, muscular activation, and perceptual responses were measured as well as blood concentrations of lactate and prolactin. Performance time was significantly faster with CWI (24.5 ± 2.8 min; P = 0.01) and SPRAY (24.6 ± 3.3 min; P = 0.01) compared to CON (25.2 ± 3.2 min).

Eleven trained male runners completed 4 randomized, preloaded running time trials (20 minutes at 70% VO<sub>2</sub>max and a 3 km time trial) on a nonmotorized treadmill in the heat (338 C). Trials consisted of precooling by combined cold-water immersion and ice slurry ingestion (PRE), midcooling by combined facial water spray and menthol mouth rinse (MID), a combination of all methods (ALL), and control (CON).

Precooling significantly reduced rectal temperature (initially by 0.5 ± 0.28 C), mean skin temperature, heart rate and sweat rate, and increased iEMG activity, whereas midcooling significantly increased expired air volume and respiratory exchange ratio compared with control. Significant decreases in forehead temperature, thermal sensation, and postexercise blood prolactin concentration were observed in all conditions compared with control.

Thirteen  experienced endurance-trained athletes (age 23.2 ± 2.3 yr, body mass 79.8 ± 8.2 kg, body height 1.82 ± 0.05 m) conducted two types of warm-ups in a cross-over design with one week in between: a long warm-up (10 min, 80% maximal heart rate, and 8x60 m sprint with increasing intensity and 1 min rest in between) and a short warm-up (8x60 m sprint with increasing intensity and 1 min rest in between). Each warm-up was followed by a 3-min  running test on a non-motorized treadmill. Total running distance, running velocity at each 30s, heart rate, blood lactate concentration, oxygen uptake, and rate of perceived exertion were  measured. No significant differences in running performance variables and physiological  parameters were found between the two warm-up protocols, except for the rate of perceived  exertion and heart rate, which were higher after the long warm-up and after the 3-min running  test compared with the short warm-up. It was concluded that a short warm-up is as effective as a long warm-up for intermediate performance. Therefore, athletes can choose for  themselves if they want to include a general part in their warm-up routines, even though it would not enhance their running performance more compared with only using a short specific  warm-up. However, to increase efficiency of time for training or competition these short specific warm-up should be performed instead of long warm-ups.

    "abstract": "The six determinants of gait proposed that the goal of gait is to minimize vertical displacement of  the body's center of mass (CoM) with the objective to optimize energy expenditure. On the contrary, recent investigations suggest that reduced vertical displacement leads to an increase in energy  expenditure. However, these investigations had the included subjects deliberately changing their gait, which could bias the endpoint measures. The present study investigated the effect of reduced vertical displacement of the CoM on oxygen uptake and walking economy without imposing altered gait patterns. This was accomplished by having subjects walk on a curved treadmill and on a flat treadmill. Vertical displacement of the CoM (sacrum marker displacement), oxygen uptake, walking economy, stride characteristics and lower limb joint angles were measured. There were significant differences in stride characteristics and phase dependent differences in lower limb movement pattern between the two conditions which in size were comparable to the changes observed between different speeds. The vertical displacement of the CoM was significantly reduced on the curved treadmill. This was accompanied by an increase in oxygen uptake and walking economy. These results support recent assertions that the six determinants of gait do not serve to improve walking economy. N=10 subjects (7 male, 3 female) included had a mean (SD) age of 21.3 (2.67) years, body mass of 75.38 (14.64) kg and height of 180.78 (6.77) cm",

    "abstract": "The onset of exercise facilitates an improvement in psychomotor performance until the second ventilatory threshold, after which performance is reduced. This inverted-U relationship appears valid for incremental and steady-state exercise, however, not for intermittent exercise. This study examined changes in psychomotor performance of team sport officials during a laboratory-based match simulation. Twelve elite Australian football (n = 5) and rugby league (n = 7) officials (32.5 ± 5.5 years; 180.0 ± 6.8 cm; 78.8 ± 7.6 kg) completed the match simulation on a non-motorised treadmill. Physiological measures were routinely taken, while psychomotor performance was assessed using the Eriksen flanker task (multiple-choice response time). Significant reductions (P < 0.05) were observed in distance covered and high-speed running during the second half when compared to the first. No significant differences (P > 0.05) in psychomotor performance at different time points were observed. Response time was significantly improved when running above 65% of maximal sprinting speed (P < 0.01). This data questions the application of the inverted-U hypothesis for intermittent exercise and suggests that the short high-intensity efforts may not result in the same physiological events that limit psychomotor performance during sustained high-intensity exercise. More so, the high-intensity efforts during the match protocol appeared to promote psychomotor performance during the intermittent exercise.",

    "abstract": "<b>BACKGROUND:</b> Pre-exercise carbohydrate (CHO) ingestion is an effective strategy for reducing the occurrence of hypoglycemia during or after exercise in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). The metabolic effects of ingestion of different chos for glycemic or performance gains have been under-researched. This study compared metabolic responses and fuel use during sub-maximal and high-intensity performance running following pre-exercise ingestion of waxy barley starch (WBS) or dextrose (DEX) in T1DM. <b>METHODS:</b> Seven participants attended the laboratory on two separate occasions following preliminary testing. on each visit participants consumed either 0.6 g/kg body mass of DEX or WBS 2 hours before a 26-minute discontinuous incremental treadmill protocol (4-minute running:  1.5-min rest) finishing at 80±4% VO<sub>2</sub>peak followed by a 10-min performance run on a non-motorized treadmill. capillary blood samples were  taken at rest, during and following exercise and analyzed for glucose (BG) and acid-base variables. Data (mean ± SEM) were analyzed using repeated measures anoVa (p<0.05). <b>RESULTS:</b> BG reached similar peak values one hour after cho ingestion and immediate pre-sub-maximal exercise BG were comparable. resting cho oxidation was elevated and lipid oxidation lower under WBS (p<0.05). There were no metabolic or cardio-respiratory differences during the sub-maximal exercise (P>0.05). In the final quartile of the performance run, a greater distance was completed under WBS (WBS 323±21 vs. DEX 301±20 m, P=0.02). <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> consumption of WBS demonstrated similar hyperglycemic responses to dextrose ingestion but a greater rate of cho use at rest. interestingly, T1DM individuals displayed an improved performance at the latter stages of a high-intensity run test.",

    "abstract": "Despite growing popularity of nonmotorized treadmills (NMTs), little data exist regarding responses during exercise testing using this equipment, which is important when providing an appropriate exercise prescription. The purpose of this study was to evaluate physiological and perceptual responses during peak graded exercise tests (GXTs) on a motorized treadmill (MT) vs. NMT. Volunteers (12 men and 12 women aged 18-35 years) performed 2 peak GXT sessions (1 MT and 1 NMT). Respiratory gases and heart rate (HR) were collected each minute; perceptual response was estimated (Borg's 6-20 rating of perceived exertion [RPE] scale) during the final 10 seconds of each stage. Peak values (i.e., V̇o2, HR, speed) were determined during the final 10 seconds of each test; ventilatory threshold (VT) was assessed using the V-slope method. Paired t-tests matching variables measured at each stage of the GXT identified significantly higher values on the NMT for V̇o2 83% of the time, HR 67% of the time, and RPE 25% of the time. Interestingly though, neither peak V̇o2 (48.6 ± 9.2 ml·kg·min<sup>-1</sup> vs. 47.8 ± 8.9 ml·kg·min<sup>-1</sup>), peak HR (185 ± 9 b·min<sup>-1</sup> vs. 188 ± 10 b·min<sup>-1</sup>; p = 0.90), nor VT (72.7 ± 5.7% vs. 73.8 ± 5.4%) were significantly different on the NMT vs. the MT. However, significant differences were identified between NMT and MT tests for time to exhaustion (9:55 ± 1:49 vs. 12:05 ± 2:48; p < 0.01) and peak speed (8.0 ± 0.9 mph vs. 9.2 ± 1.4 mph; p < 0.01). Thus, although peak values obtained were similar between testing sessions on the NMT and MT, the majority of submaximal data were significantly different between trials. These differences are important when designing exercise prescriptions using submaximal values from NMT testing that may be inappropriately high or low at corresponding intensities during training.",

Eleven moderately trained male runners completed familiarization and three randomized, crossover 5-km running time trials on a non-motorized treadmill in hot conditions (33 °C). The trials included ice slurry ingestion before exercise (ICE), menthol mouth rinse during exercise (MEN), and no intervention (CON). Running performance was significantly improved with MEN (25.3 ± 3.5 min; P = 0.01), but not ICE (26.3 ± 3.2 min; P = 0.45) when compared with CON (26.0 ± 3.4 min). Rectal temperature was significantly decreased with ICE (by 0.3 ± 0.2 °C; P < 0.01), which persisted for 2 km of the run and MEN significantly decreased perceived thermal sensation (between 4 and 5 km) and ventilation (between 1 and 2 km) during the time trial. End-exercise blood prolactin concentration was elevated with MEN compared with CON (by 25.1 ± 24.4 ng/mL; P = 0.02). The data demonstrate that a change in the perception of thermal sensation during exercise from menthol mouth rinse was associated with improved endurance running performance in the heat.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare perceptual and physiological variables between running on three different modalities — an indoor athletics track, a motorized treadmill, and a non-motorized curved treadmill — for 1000 m at three different velocities. Ten male athletes (age 24±3 years, body mass 69.8±6.91 kg, height 1.80±0.06 m, VO2peak 69.0±6.70 ml/kg/ min) conducted three 1000 m laps at increasing velocity on three different running modalities. The athletes had a 3-minute recovery between each lap, where the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) was registered and the blood lactate concentration and heart rate were measured. Oxygen uptake was measured using a portable metabolic analyser. The physiological (oxygen uptake, heart rate, and blood lactate concentration) and perceptual (RPE) variables were higher when running on a non-motorized curved treadmill compared with running on the track or a motorized treadmill. No differences were found between running on a motorized treadmill and the track except for the RPE, which was lower when running on the track compared with the motorized treadmill. Running on a non-motorized curved treadmill at three different velocities results in a higher oxygen uptake (37%) and heart rate (22%) and is subjectively much harder than running on a track or a motorized treadmill at the same velocities. The difference is around 4 km/h when comparing the physiological and perceptual responses. Thus, when performing training sessions on a non-motorized curved treadmill, subjects should subtract 4 km/h from their regular pace on a track or motorized treadmill to get the same response considering oxygen uptake, heart rate, RPE and blood lactate concentration.",

Functional methods assessing hamstring function during high-risk performance tasks such as sprinting are vital to identify potential risk factors. The purpose of this study was to assess horizontal force deficits during maximum sprint running on a non-motorized treadmill in football players with previous history of hamstring strains as a pre-season risk-assessment in a club setting. 17 male football players from one Premier League Club were divided into 2 groups, experimental (n= 6, age = 24.5 ± 2.3 years) and control (n= 11, age = 21.3 ± 1.2 years), according to history of previous hamstring injury. Participants performed a protocol including a 10 seconds maximum sprint on a non-motorized treadmill. Force deficits during acceleration phase and steady state phases of the sprint were assessed between limbs and between groups. The main outcome measures were horizontal and vertical peak forces during the acceleration phase or steady state. There were no significant differences in peak forces between previously injured and non-injured limbs, or between groups, challenging the ideas around functional force deficits in sprint running as a diagnostic measure of hamstring re-injury risk.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of an automated technique that uses belt speed data from an NMT to estimate temporal-spatial gait parameters. Seventeen injuryfree adult participants performed a series of 20-s, metronome-guided walking and running trials for each of eight predetermined cadence conditions (72-200 steps/min). Two NMT-based cadence algorithms [PSD estimated cadence (PEC) and threshold estimated cadence (TEC)], and one NMT-based step length algorithm (NMT_SL) were evaluated for their ability to predict traditional motion analysis-based measures of cadence and step length (MAC and MA_SL, respectively). The results of this study demonstrate that both the PEC and TEC algorithms were capable of predicting MAC with a standard error of the estimate (SEE) less than four steps/min (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.997 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.993, respectively). Predictions of MA_SL from NMT_SL were separated by gait type (walking vs. running) to account for an obvious separation in the step length data with a qualitative gait change. When applied to walking data, NMT_SL was capable of predicting MA_SL with an SEE of 23 mm (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.96). When applied to running data, NMT_SL was capable of predicting MA_SL with an SEE of 44 mm (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.80). The assessment of the novel technique suggests that it is feasible to use non-motorized treadmill belt speed data to predict gait events and analyze simple gait metrics. Future research should evaluate the applicability of these algorithms for use with participants/patients presenting with pathological gait.

Twenty-eight healthy, physically active men (n = 14) and women (n = 14) (age = 22.9 ± 2.4 years; body mass = 77.1 ± 16.2 kg; height = 171.6 ± 11.2 cm; body-fa t = 19.4 ± 8.1%) completed one familiarization and one 30-s maximal sprint on the TM to obtain maximal sprinting speed, POW and FRC. Muscle thickness (MT), cross-sectional area (CSA) and echo intensity (ECHO) of the RF and VL in the dominant (DOM; determined by unilateral sprinting power) and non-dominant (ND) legs were measured via ultrasound. Pearson correlations indicated several significant (p < 0.05) relationships between sprinting performance [POW (peak, DOM and ND), FRC (peak, DOM, ND) and sprinting time] and muscle architecture. Stepwise regression indicated that POWDOM was predictive of ipsilateral RF (MT and CSA) and VL (CSA and ECHO), while POWND was predictive of ipsilateral RF (MT and CSA) and VL (CSA); sprinting power/force asymmetry was not predictive of architecture asymmetry. Sprinting time was best predicted by peak power and peak force, though muscle quality (ECHO) and the bilateral percent difference in VL (CSA) were strong architectural predictors. Muscle architecture is related to (and predictive of) TM sprinting performance, while unilateral POW is predictive of ipsilateral architecture. However, the extent to which architecture and other factors (i.e. neuromuscular control and sprinting technique) affect TM performance remains unknown.",

Subjects completed two separate trials (i. RSN, ii. RSH; randomised order) between 48 h and 72 h apart on a non-motorized treadmill. In addition to performance, we examined blood lactate concentration [La-] and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) before, during, and after the RSR444. While there were no differences in peak speed or distance during set 1 or set 2, peak speed (p = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively) and distance (p = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively) were greater during set 3 and set 4 of RSN compared with RSH. There was no difference in the average acceleration achieved in set 1 (p = 0.45), set 2 (p = 0.26), or set 3 (p = 0.23) between RSN and RSH; however, the average acceleration was greater in RSN than RSH in set 4 (p <  0.01). Measurements of [La-] were higher during RSH than RSN immediately after Sprint 16 (10.2 ± 2.5 vs 8.6 ± 2.6 mM; p = 0.02). Estimations of SpO2 were lower during RSH than RSN, respectively, immediately prior to the commencement of the test (89.0 ± 2.0 vs 97.2 ± 1.5 %), post Sprint 8 (78.0 ± 6.3 vs 93.8 ± 3.6 %) and post Sprint 16 (75.3 ± 6.3 vs 94.5 ± 2.5 %; all p < 0.01). In summary, the RSR444 is a practical protocol for the implementation of a hypoxic repeated-sprint training intervention into the training schedules of team-sport athletes. However, given the inability of amateur team-sport athletes to maintain performance in hypoxic (FiO<sub>2</sub> = 0.140) conditions, the potential for specific training outcomes (i.e. speed) to be achieved will be compromised, thus suggesting that the RSR444 should be used with caution.",

Study design: Crossover. <b>Setting:</b> Clinical research laboratory. <b>Participants:</b> 10 healthy athletic adults. <b> Main outcome measures:</b> Participants walked (1.34 m s<sup>-1</sup>) for 3 min and ran (2.24 m s <sup>-1</sup>) for 4 min on NMCT and SMT (randomized order) while metabolic data and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were collected. Participants then identified preferred easy and moderate intensity training paces on each treadmill while blinded to speed. Repeated-measures ANOVA and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests were used to compare responses between treadmills. <b>Results:</b> Intensity was significantly greater (P < 0.001) for NMCT than SMT [mean (95% confidence interval): Walking = 5.9(5.3,6.4) vs. 3.4(3.0,3.7) METs; Running = 10.7(9,6,11.7) vs. 7.3(6.8,7.8) METs]. Overall RPE was significantly greater (P < 0.01) on NMCT than SMT for walking [median (inter-quartile range): 7(1) vs. 6(0.8)] and running [11.5(3) vs. 8(2.5)]. Preferred speed was significantly slower on NMCT than SMT for easy [2.5(2.3,2.7) vs. 2.8(2.5,3.1) m·s <sup>-1</sup>] and moderate [3.2(3.0,3.4) vs. 3.5(3.1,3.9) m·s <sup>-1</sup>] intensities. <b>Conclusions:</b> NMCT elicits greater physiological stimulus than SMT with small, though statistically significant, changes in RPE at matched speeds.

Ten male runners performed randomised 5-km running time trials on a NMT and an outdoor athletics track. A range of physiological and perceptual responses was measured, and foot strike was classified subjectively. Performance time was strongly correlated (r = 0.82, ICC = 0.86) between running modes, despite running time being significantly longer on the NMT (1264 ± 124 s vs. 1536 ± 130 s for overground and NMT, respectively; P < 0.001). End blood lactate concentration and rating of perceived exertion were significantly higher on the NMT compared to overground. Integrated electromyography was significantly lower on the NMT for three muscles (P < 0.05), and mean stride rate was also significantly lower on the NMT (P = 0.04). Cardiorespiratory responses of heart rate, oxygen uptake and expired air volume demonstrated strong correlations (r = 0.68-0.96, ICC = 0.75-0.97) and no statistical differences (P > 0.05). Runners were consistently slower on the NMT, and as such it should not be used to measure performance over a specific distance. However, the strong correlations suggest that superior overground performance was reflected in relative terms on the NMT, and therefore, it is a valid tool for the assessment of endurance running performance in the laboratory.

Ten male team-sport athletes (20.3 ± 1.2 y, 74.4 ± 9.7 kg, VO<sub>2</sub>peak 57.1 ± 4.5 ml∙kg-1∙min<sup>-1</sup>) attended five sessions (VO<sub>2</sub>peak testing + familiarisation; four reliability trials). The 30-min protocol consisted of three idenitcal 10-min activity blocks, with visual and audible commands directing locomotor activity; however, actual speeds were self-selected by participants. Reliability of variables was estimated using typical error ± 90% confidence limits expressed as a percentage [coefifcient of variation (CV)] and intraclass correlation coefficient. The smallest worthwhile change (SWC) was calculated as 0.2 x between participant standard deviation. Peak/mean speed and distance variables assessed across the 30-min protocol exhibited a CV < 5%, and < 6% for each 10-min activity block. All power variables exhibited a CV < 7.5%, except walking (CV 8.3-10.1%). The most reliable variables were maximum and mean sprint speed (CV < 2%). All variables produced a CV% greater than the SWC. A self-paced, team-sport running protocol preformed on a NMT produces reliable speed/distance and power data. Importantly, a single familiarisation session allowed for adequate test-retest reliability. The self-paced design provides an ecologically-valid alternative to externall-paced team-sport running simulations.",

    "abstract": "Despite the available literature addressing the placebo effect's role in mediating human performance, there is a paucity of research addressing the possibility of a placebo effect both within and between bouts of repeated sprint performance on consecutive days. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether the administration of a placebo influences recovery during sessions of intermittent sprinting. Ten subjects performed 4 repeated sprint tests under 2 different conditions; 2 while being administered a control beverage separated by 24 hours of recovery and the other 2 with a placebo beverage separated by 24 hours of recovery. Before each sprint test, subjects provided perceived recovery status (PRS). Ratings of perceived exertion were recorded within 5 seconds after each sprint. After each repeated sprint protocol, subjects were asked to provide a rating of perceived exertion (RPE), rate their pain, and provided a blood lactate sample. Power was recorded throughout each session from a nonmotorized treadmill to analyze changes in sprinting performance. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to determine significant differences in peak and mean power, PRS, RPE, pain, and blood lactate. The placebo trial produced significantly higher peak (p < 0.001) and mean power (p = 0.002) vs. the control in later sprints absent of any other significant difference in metabolic or perceptual strain (p > 0.05). In conclusion, it seems that the administration of a placebo can attenuate the decline in performance as fatigue increases during repeated sprinting bouts.

Twenty National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I men's hockey athletes performed identical sessions of repeated sprint work pre- and postseason. The repeated sprint test consisted of 5 sets of 45 seconds of repeated sprint work with 90 seconds of rest in between each series of sprints. Power output (W), decrement, and recovery scores (RECs) were determined using raw data from a nonmotorized treadmill. Ratings of perceived exertion were recorded after, and perceived readiness (PR) recorded before, each series of sprints. Mean power was significantly higher in preseason vs. postseason performance during sprint 1 (760.6 vs. 691.3 W; p = 0.03), sprint 2 (719.9 vs 657.0 W; p = 0.05), sprint 4 (648.4 vs 588.9 W; p = 0.04), and sprint 5 (656.6 vs. 586.8 W, p = 0.04). Ratings of perceived exertion were significantly higher during sprints 3, 4, and 5 postseason with PR significantly higher (indicating less readiness) before sprints 3 and 4. There were no significant differences in REC or decrement score. Overall, athletes were unable to maintain power during subsequent repeated sprint work during postseason. The degree to which the athletes fatigued and recovered between sprints did not change between pre- and postseason testing, however, athletes exhibit increased perceptual strain during the repeated sprint work.

    "abstract": "The relationships between 30-m sprint time and performance on a nonmotorized treadmill (TM) test and a vertical jump test were determined in this investigation. Seventy-eight physically active men and women (22.9 ± 2.7 years; 73.0 ± 14.7 kg; 170.7 ± 10.4 cm) performed a 30-second maximal sprint on the curve nonmotorized TM after 1 familiarization trial. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients produced significant (p ≤ 0.05) moderate to very strong relationships between 30-m sprint time and body mass (r = -0.37), %fat (r = 0.79), peak power (PP) (r = -0.59), relative PP (r = -0.42), time to peak velocity (r = -0.23) and TM sprint times at 10 m (r = 0.48), 20 m (r = 0.59), 30 m (r = 0.67), 40 m (r = 0.71), and 50 m (r = 0.75). Strong relationships between 30-m sprint time and peak (r = -0.479) and mean vertical jump power (r = -0.559) were also observed. Subsequently, stepwise regression was used to produce two 30-m sprint time prediction models from TM performance (TM1: body mass + TM data and TM2: body composition + TM data) in a validation group (n = 39), and then crossvalidated against another group (n = 39). As no significant differences were observed between these groups, data were combined (n = 72) and used to create the final prediction models (TM1: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.75, standard error of the estimate (SEE) = 0.27 seconds; TM2: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.84, SEE = 0.22 seconds). These final movement-specific models seem to be more accurate in predicting 30-m sprint time than derived peak (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.23, SEE = 0.48 seconds) and mean vertical jump power (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.31, SEE = 0.45 seconds) equations. Consequently, sprinting performance on the TM can significantly predict short-distance sprint time. It, therefore, may be used to obtain movement-specific measures of sprinting force, velocity, and power in a controlled environment from a single 30-second maximal sprinting test.

Repeated sprint training has been shown to improve RSA, we hypothesised that hypoxia would augment these training adaptations. Thirty male well-trained academy rugby union and rugby league players (18.4±1.5 years, 1.83±0.07 m, 88.1±8.9 kg) participated in this singleblind repeated sprint training study. Participants completed 12 sessions of repeated sprint training (10x6 s, 30 s recovery) over 4 weeks in either hypoxia (13% FiO2) or normoxia (21% F<sub>i</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Pretraining and post-training, participants completed sports specific endurance and sprint field tests and a 10x6 s RSA test on a non-motorised treadmill while measuring speed, heart rate, capillary blood lactate, muscle and cerebral deoxygenation and respiratory measures. Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Level 1 test performance improved after RS training in both groups, but gains were significantly greater in the hypoxic (33±12%) than the normoxic group (14±10%, p<0.05). During the 10x6 s RS test there was a tendency for greater increases in oxygen consumption in the hypoxic group (hypoxic 6.9±9%, normoxic (-0.3±8.8%, p=0.06) and reductions in cerebral deoxygenation (% changes for both groups, p=0.09) after hypoxic than normoxic training. Twelve RS training sessions in hypoxia resulted in twofold greater improvements in capacity to perform repeated aerobic high intensity workout than an equivalent normoxic training. Performance gains are evident in the short term (4 weeks), a period similar to a preseason training block.",

    "abstract": "A curved treadmill offers a practical method of assessing anaerobic power by enabling unrestricted running motion and greater sport specificity. The purpose of this research was to determine reliability of a curved treadmill (cTM) sprint test and to compare performance measures to the traditional Wingate anaerobic power test (WAnT) performed on a cycle ergometer. Thirty-two recreationally active men and women (22.4 ± 2.8 yrs; 1.73 ± 0.08 m; 74. 2 ± 13.2 kg) performed four familiarization trials on cTM, followed by two randomly assigned experimental trials consisting of one 30-second maximum effort on either cTM or WAnT. Each trial was separated by at least 48 hours. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), interclass correlations (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), and minimal differences (MD) were used to determine reliability of familiarization trials on cTM, and Pearson product moment correlations were calculated to compare cTM and WAnT. ANOVA results showed significant differences (p < 0.05) during the four familiarization trials. Post hoc analysis showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) between the first two trials. Familiarization trials 3 and 4 showed a high reliability for each performance variable (distance: ICC2,1 = 0.969, %SEM = 2.645, p = 0.157; mean velocity: ICC2,1 = 0. 969, %SEM = 2.622, p = 0.173; peak velocity: ICC2,1 = 0.966, %SEM = 3.142, p = 0.033; mean power: ICC2,1 = 0.940, %SEM = 4.140, p = 0.093; and peak power: ICC2,1 = 0.887, %SEM = 11.244, p = 0.669). Participants elicited an average peak power of 1050.4 ± 338.5 Watts on cTM and 1031.4 ± 349.8 Watts on WAnT. Pearson product moment coefficients indicated high correlations between peak power, mean power, and peak velocity (r = 0.75, p < 0.001; r = 0.84, p < 0.001; and r = 0.76, p < 0. 001, respectively) derived from cTM and WAnT. In conclusion, results suggest that after two familiarization trials, cTM is a reliable sprint test for recreationally active men and women. In addition, there are strong relationships between cTM and WAnT in assessing anaerobic performance. Key points: The Woodway Curve 3.0(TM) is a non-motorized treadmill utilizing a curved platform which allows individuals to simulate an unrestricted sprint test in a laboratory setting, offering a practical and sport specific method of assessing anaerobic power.The curved treadmill provides a reliable sprint test for recreationally active men and women.There are strong relationships between the curved treadmill and cycle ergometer in assessing anaerobic performance.

    "abstract": "The Rockport Walk Test (RWT) is a 1-mile walk used to estimate the maximal volume of oxygen uptake (VO2max). The purpose of this study was to validate the RWT on a nonmotorized curved treadmill (CT). Twenty-three healthy adults (10 females; 19-44 years old) participated. One trial of the RWT was performed on a measured indoor track (RWTO) and another on the CT (RWTC) on different days in randomized order. Heart rate (HR) and completion time were used to calculate VO2max using 6 different general and gender specific equations from previous research. Subjects also performed a treadmill graded exercise test (GXT), which was used as the criterion measure for VO2max. Completion times and HR between the 2 RWT were compared using dependent t-tests. Estimated VO2max values were compared between the RWTC, RWTO, and GXT through repeated measures analysis of variance, Pearson's correlations (r), and Bland-Altman's plots. There was no difference between completion times for the RWTO and RWTC but HRs were significantly higher with RWTC. When the same equation was applied to the RWTO and RWTC, there were no similar results. All VO2max estimations were different from observed VO2max except for the estimation from the relative general Kline et al. equation on the RWTO. Despite high correlations (r = 0.75-0.91), the RWTC underestimated VO2max. The RWTC underestimates VO2max but may be beneficial if a new equation were created specifically for the CT. With appropriate equations for the CT, the RWTC would provide an alternate form of VO2max testing. N = 23 (10 females and 13 males).

    "abstract": "<b>Purpose</b> Individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are encouraged to reduce rapid-acting insulin and consume CHO to prevent hypoglycemia during or after exercise. However, research comparing the metabolic and performance effects of different CHO is limited. This study compared the alterations in metabolism and fuel oxidation in response to performance running after preexercise ingestion of isomaltulose or dextrose in T1DM. <b>Methods</b> After preliminary testing, on two occasions, seven T1DM individuals consumed 0.6 g·kg<sup>-1</sup> body mass of either dextrose (DEX; glycemic index = 96) or isomaltulose (ISO; glycemic index = 32), 2 h before a discontinuous incremental run to 80% V˙O2peak on a motorized treadmill followed by a 10-min all-out performance test on a nonmotorized treadmill. Blood glucose (BG), acid-base, and cardiorespiratory parameters were measured 2 h before, during, and after both run tests. Data (mean ± SEM) were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. <b>Results</b> Preexercise BG area under the curve was lower under ISO in comparison with DEX (ISO = +4.0 ± 0.3 mmol·L<sup>-1</sup>·h<sup>-1</sup> vs DEX = +7.0 ± 0.6 mmol·L<sup>-1</sup>·h<sup>-1</sup>, P < 0.01). Resting blood lactate concentrations and rate of CHO oxidation under ISO were greater than those elicited under DEX (P < 0.05). There were no metabolic or cardiorespiratory differences between conditions in response to submaximal exercise despite lower BG concentrations under ISO (P < 0.05). T1DM individuals completed the same distance at the same speed during the 10-min run test under both conditions (not significant). <b>Conclusions</b> Consumption of isomaltulose alongside rapid-acting insulin reduction improves BG responses to exercise and produces a similar high-intensity run performance compared with dextrose in T1DM individuals.N=7 (2 men, 5 women; 34 ± 5 years",

    "abstract": "Previous literature suggests that muscular involvement and biomechanical changes elicit different responses between overground and treadmill training. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of training on two different treadmill designs on the conventional (CR; concentric only) and functional (FR; eccentric to concentric) hamstring and quadriceps strength ratios. Fifteen men and sixteen women were randomly divided into three groups: motorized (MT), non-motorized (NMT) or control (C). Subjects completed pre and post-test isokinetic concentric and eccentric quadriceps and hamstring testing of both legs. Subjects completed 4 weeks of training on their respective treadmills with mileage increasing 1/2 mile each week, beginning with 2 miles. The C group did not participate in any training. The CR revealed a significant two way interaction of group x time with MT increasing (pre: 0.80 ± 0.09 to post: 0.84 ± 0.09), NMT decreasing (pre: 0.76 ± 0.13 to post: 0.74 ± 0.10), and C showing no change (pre: 0.79 ± 0.10 to post: 0.79 ± 0.09. The FR revealed a significant two way interaction of speed x sex with the FR increasing as speeds increased for men (60 degrees.s-1: 1.04 ± 0.11; 180 degrees.s<sup>-1</sup>: 1.66± 0.27; 300 degrees•s<sup>-1</sup>: 2.36± 0.45) and women (60 degrees•s<sup>-1</sup>: 1.05 ± 0.16; 180 degrees•s<sup>-1</sup>: 1.90± 0.26; 300 degrees•s<sup>-1</sup>: 2.75 ± 0.47) but women increased greater relative to men. Training mode elicited a specific change in concentric hamstring and quadriceps strength resulting in specific changes to the CR; however, neither training mode had an effect on eccentric hamstrings nor the FR. Special attention should be given to the mode of endurance training when the goal is to alter the hamstring/quadriceps CR. n=15 men (age: 22.67 ± 2.16 years; height 1.78 ± 0.09 m; mass 83.00 ± 14.22 kg) and 16 women (age: 22.31 ± 1.62 years; height 1.65 ± 0.06 m; mass 73.33 ± 15.69 kg)",

    "abstract": "Historically, non-motorized treadmills have been very large and required the stabilization of participants by either holding onto surrounding objects or wearing a harness during exercise sessions. Recently, smaller curved non-motorized treadmills have become available and are now being utilized in fitness centers. <b>PURPOSE:</b> To determine the physiological responses to walking on a curved non-motorized treadmill and to compare these responses to those of walking on a motorized treadmill. <b>METHODS:</b> Physically active, healthy college students (n = 11, males = 6, females = 5) walked on the motorized (MT) and a curved non-motorized (CT) treadmills at 2.4, 4.0 and 5.6 km · hour<sup>-1</sup>. Each exercise bout lasted for 6 minutes. A 10 minute rest period occurred between exercises on each treadmill and all exercise bouts occurred on the same day. The order of use for the treadmills was randomized. All subjects had experience on both treadmills prior to any testing being performed. Heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake variables (V̇o2, VE, RR, RER), muscle oxygenation (StO2) and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) during the last minute of each exercise bout were used for analysis. A two-way ANOVA with repeated measures was performed, followed by dependent t-tests where appropriate (*P<0.05). <b>RESULTS:</b> Oxygen uptake variables and HR were all significantly greater for the CT than for the MT (see table below). The RPE and StO<sub>2</sub> variables followed this trend, though not all of the differences were significant (table values in mean ± SD). <b>DISCUSSION:</b> All subjects easily performed all speeds on the CT without the assistance of a harness or holding on. All speeds were easily walked, except the CT5.6, which resulted in a very fast walk that bordered on jogging. The increased physical effort, as indicated by higher V̇o2 and HR values, while walking on the CT is probably due to the greater friction and/or increased muscle activation inherent with the use of a non-motorized treadmill. The results indicate that for those individuals who cannot attain desired increases in exercise intensity through jogging or running, significantly increased energy expenditure at the same speed and perceived exertion can occur while walking on the CT. <b>PRACTICAL APPLICATION:</b> The increased energy expenditure at each of the given walking speeds on the CT could have dramatic implications for populations that cannot achieve running speeds. For individuals whom are overweight, diseased or returning from injury, walking on the CT could allow the attainment of HR values similar to those achieved during running. The current study utilized a healthy, active population, but the results should be applicable to the aforementioned populations that cannot generally maintain running speeds for desired durations.
