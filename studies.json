    "keyFindings": "Self-selected and fixed rest approaches with matched total rest durations result in similar performance",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies on rest durations during high-intensity interval training (HIIT) often compare fixed and self-selected (SS) rest allocation approaches.  Frequently, the rest duration under SS conditions is unlimited, leading to  inconsistent total rest durations compared to fixed rest conditions. To address  this limitation, we recently compared fixed and SS rest conditions during cycling  HIIT sessions, while keeping the total rest duration equivalent. However, our  protocol required athletes to divide a long total rest duration (720s) across  nine intervals, which may have been overly cognitively demanding. The current  study aimed to explore the effects of the SS approach with a simplified rest  allocation task on performance, physiological, and psychological outcomes.  METHODS: Following a familiarization session, 24 professional female soccer  players completed two running HIIT sessions on a non-motorized treadmill. Each  session consisted of twelve 15s intervals, divided into three blocks, with the  goal of maximizing the distance covered. In both conditions, the between-interval  rest duration per block amounted to 270s. In the fixed condition, the rest was  uniformly allocated to 90s between each interval, whereas in the SS condition,  the athletes chose how to allocate the entirety of the 270s of rest. We compared  the following outcomes: distance, heart rate, perception of fatigue, effort,  autonomy, enjoyment, boredom, and athletes' preferences. Outcomes were compared  using aggregated measures via paired univariate tests, and across the intervals  via mixed-effects models. RESULTS: We observed comparable results in most  outcomes with the exception of higher autonomy (1-15 points) in the SS condition  (mean difference=2.1, 95%CI (0.9, 3.3) points) and a negligibly higher heart  rate in the SS condition when comparing the observations across intervals  (estimate=2.5, 95%CI (0.9, 4.2) beats X min(-1)). Additionally, participants  chose to rest for longer durations as the block progressed. Finally, the majority  of participants (65%) favored the SS condition. CONCLUSION: This study further  solidifies that SS and fixed approaches with matched total rest durations result  in similar performance, physiological, and psychological responses. This effect  persists even when the total rest duration required to be allocated is relatively  short. Therefore, coaches and trainees can choose either approach based on their  preferences and training goals.",
